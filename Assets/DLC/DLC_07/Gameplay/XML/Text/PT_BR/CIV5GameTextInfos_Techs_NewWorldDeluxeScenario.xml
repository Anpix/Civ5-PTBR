		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_NEWWORLD_SCENARIO_TECH_ADVANCED_PIRACY_DESC">
			<Text>The "Golden Age of Piracy" spanned, roughly, the years from 1650 to 1730 AD as the likes of Henry Morgan, Bartholomew Roberts and Calico Jack Rackham sailed the Spanish Main. It was brought about by both the incredible riches being shipped to Europe from the New World and by advances in shipbuilding, allowing fast and nimble sloops, brigantines and schooners to carry heavier weaponry and larger crews.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_NEWWORLD_SCENARIO_TECH_LINE_OF_BATTLE_DESC">
			<Text>Although its first use in battle is a matter of debate (ranging from 1502 to 1652 AD), by 1675 the "line-of-battle" tactic was the most common formation being used by European navies. In contrast to the usual naval melees, in line-of-battle each warship could fire its broadside without hitting friendly vessels, allowing for both concentrated and continuous fire.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_NEWWORLD_SCENARIO_TECH_MERCHANT_FLEET_DESC">
			<Text>In the face of depredations from buccaneers and privateers, in the mid-1500s the Spanish and Portuguese adopted an early form of convoys for their merchant ships plying the Atlantic trade routes. Whereas the treasure fleets were usually accompanied by warships, the private merchant fleets were not; hence many of the galleons - laden with tobacco, spices, lumber, sugar, grain, pearls and other luxuries for the European markets - were armed with cannons and carronades to ward off the smaller pirate ships.</Text>

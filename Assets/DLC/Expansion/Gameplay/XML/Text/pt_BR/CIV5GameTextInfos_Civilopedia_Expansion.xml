			<Text>Nobre e virtuosa Rainha Maria Teresa, Imperatriz do Sacro Império Romano e soberana da Áustria, as pessoas se curvam à vossa vontade graciosa. Após a morte de vosso pai, o rei Carlos VI, vós ascendestes ao trono da Áustria durante um período de grande instabilidade, mas os cofres vazios e militares reduzidos pouco fizeram para dissuadir vossas ambições. Confrontando a guerra quase que imediatamente após a vossa sucessão ao trono, conseguistes afastar vossos inimigos e ao nomear vosso marido Francis Stephen Francis co-governante, garantistes vosso lugar como Imperatriz do Sacro Império Romano. Durante vosso reinado, guiastes a Áustria em um novo caminho de reforma - fortalecendo os militares, repondo o tesouro e melhorando o sistema educacional do reino.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ó grande rainha, ousada e digna, chegou o momento para que vós levanteis e guieis o reino mais uma vez. Podereis retornar o seu povo à altura da prosperidade e esplendor? Construireis uma civilização que resista ao teste do tempo?</Text>

Vinda das posições mais inferiores de atrizes e cortesãs, vós vos tornastes a mulher mais poderosa no Império Romano, consorte de Justiniano I. A partir do final dos anos 520 d.C., juntastes-vos ao vosso marido em uma série de importantes reformas espirituais e jurídicas, criando muitas leis que elevaram o status e promoveram a igualdade de tratamento das mulheres no império.

			<Text>Derivando seu nome do termo em Alto Alemão Antigo "Ostarrichi", registrado pela primeira vez em 996 pelo Sacro Imperador Romano Otto III, a pequena nação encravada da Áustria há muito é um jogador influente nas sagas políticas e militares da Europa. Começando no século XIII com o reinado de quase 650 anos da poderosa Monarquia Habsburgo, A Áustria emergiu como uma das principais nações da Europa, estabelecendo fortes alianças e abrangentes acordos de comércio pelo continente. A posterior união da Áustria e Hungria como um único império trouxe estabilidade a ambas as nações, a ser quebrada pela turbulência da Iª Guerra Mundial, e eventualmente, pela ocupação alemã da IIª Guerra Mundial. No rescaldo desses grandes conflitos, as fronteiras da Áustria foram recriadas, e a independente República da Áustria é hoje uma nação democrática que se orgulha manter neutralidade e estabilidade.</Text>

Encravada entre rivais e aliados, a Áustria e seu povo tem uma longa história de adaptação às situações sempre mudando ao seu redor.

			<Text>A história mais antiga da Áustria centra-se nos celtas nômades e seus conflitos com o Império Romano expansionista. Nos estágios finais do primeiro milênio aC, a área que hoje constitui a Áustria era habitada por tribos celtas ao norte do Rio Danúbio. Estes primeiros celtas originaram-se da Cultura Hallstatt, assim chamada por causa da aldeia austríaca de Hallstatt onde a maioria de seus artefatos foram descobertos. A chegada dos romanos por volta de 200 aC marcou o fim do domínio celta na área, quando os romanos subjugaram rapidamente a população local e tomaram o controle da região. Foi durante esse período que o antigo assentamento celta de Vindobona foi capturado e convertido em um posto militar romano. Inicialmente um acampamento para as tropas romanas, Vindobona tornou-se um importante centro de comércio ao longo do Danúbio, tornando-se o local da futura capital da Áustria, Viena.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Embora os romanos mantivessem o domínio sobre o sul da Áustria por várias centenas de anos, no século III dC, tribos germânicas cada vez mais poderosas do norte estavam avançando em território controlado pelos romanos. No século V, essa perda de território era apenas um dos muitos problemas enfrentados por Roma, à medida que o declínio do império se descontrolava, permitindo que colonos da Baviera e arredores se movessem sem contestação. A cidade de Vindobona foi capturada pelos nômades Avars em 630 dC, que foram então conquistados por Carlos Magno no final do século VIII.</Text>

Uma Marca, ou território de fronteira, era usada para designar regiões de fronteira na Europa Medieval. A Marca da Áustria foi delineada pelo Sacro Imperador Romano Emperor Otto II e substituiu todas as designações anteriores da área, incluindo a Marca Avar definida por Charlemagne no século VIII abrangendo a mesma região. A região seria mais tarde referida como Ostarrichi pelo filho de Otto, Otto III.</Text>

O título "Marquês" era conferido a condes que governavam marchas medievais, em papel primariamente militar enquanto esses territórios eram usados para proteger o coração do império.

			<Text>A Dinastia Habsburgo, estabelecida pelo Rei Germano Rodofo I de Habsburgo no século XIII, cresceu para se tornar uma das mais poderosas casas governantes de toda a Europa. O último dos Babenbergs, Duque Frederico II, morreu em 1246, dando aos Habsburgos a oportunidade de tomar o controle da região. Seguindo sua seleção como Sacro Imperador Romano, Rodolfo reivindicou as províncias da Áustria e enfrentou uma disputa pela sucessão com o Príncipe Boêmio Otacar II. O resultado favorável a Rodolfo permitiu que instalasse seus dois filhos, Rodolfo II e Alberto I, como co-governantes, os primeiros da linha Habsburgo na Áustria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pelos próximos 600 anos, os Habsburgos gozariam de influência e autoridade crescentes na Europa, conquistando notavelmente a coroa do Sacro Império Romano em 1452 com a seleção de Frederico III pelo Popa Nicolau V. O salto de Frederico ao conquistar a posição de Sacro Imperador Romano iniciou uma expansão ainda maior do reinado Habsburgo, que controlou a Áustria e o Sacro Império Romano até o início do século XIX.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Durante seu longo reinado, os Habsburgos foram bem-sucedidos em reivindicar vários territórios que cercavam seu trono na Áustria, principalmente a Hungria. Foco frequente dos conflitos entre o Império Habsburgo e os Turcos Otomanos ocupando largas extensões da nação, a Hungria eventualmente caiu sob conpleto controle da Áustria depois das perdas decisivas dos Otomanos na Batalha de Viena e a eventual resolução da Grande Guerra Turca em 1699.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A última dos Monarcas Habsburgos Austríacos, Maria Teresa, reinou no século XVIII e encarou uma guerra sobre seu direito de sucessão logo depois da morte de seu pai. Como primeira mulher a liderar a Monarquia Habsburgo, Maria foi desprezada pelas forças européias da França e da rival Prússia, que disputaram sua reivindicação pelo trono e incitaram a Guerra de Sucessão Austríaca. Depois de nove anos de conflito a guerra foi resolvida em 1748, com Maria Teresa afirmada como governante da Áustria, mas ao custo de ceder a valiosa província de Silesia à Prussia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]O reinado de Maria Teresa foi marcado por um contínuo aumento na estabilidadde de sua nação, graças em parte à sua consideração cuidadosa das políticas econômicas e sociais que instituiu. Equilibrando o orçamento da Áustria através do aumento de taxação e regulação dos gastos a permitiram fortalecer o esgotado exército da Áustria, enquanto melhorias na educação e medicina impulsionaram o bem-estar do seu povo.</Text>

			<Text>A eclosão das guerras napoleônicas, a partir do final do século XVIII, levou à criação de várias coalizões contrárias ao Império Francês de Napoleão. A Áustria aderiu à Primeira Coalizão contra Napoleão em 1793 e, apesar de uma invasão multifacetada da França a que se juntaram várias potências europeias, os franceses conseguiram repelir os invasores. Apesar do revés, a Áustria continuou a se opor aos franceses e se juntou à maioria das sete coalizões que se levantaram para enfrentar Napoleão. Infelizmente, os primeiros esforços da Áustria levaram apenas à derrota, e o imperador romano Francisco II formou o Império Austríaco em 1804, numa tentativa de consolidar suas terras na região, nomeando-se imperador da Áustria. Abdicando o trono do Sacro Imperador Romano, Francisco assinou o Tratado de Pressburg em 1805, dissolvendo o próprio Sacro Império Romano a fim de deslegitimar as reivindicações feitas por Napoleão às terras alemãs através da formação da Confederação do Reno. Após a derrota de Napoleão em 1813, as forças aliadas contra a França dissolveram sua confederação, que foi recriada como Confederação Alemã logo em seguida.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Como uma união de estados europeus unidos pela língua alemã, a Confederação Alemã foi formada com Áustria e Prússia juntando-se como seus membros mais poderosos. No entanto, a cooperação entre os dois rivais históricos teve curta duração. A Prússia e sua aliada mais próxima, a Itália, invadiram o disputado estado de Holstein, provocando a Áustria à guerra em 1866. A Áustria, unida pela maioria dos membros da confederação, enfrentou os superiores militares prussianos. Depois de um breve conflito, a Prússia conseguiu uma vitória decisiva sobre a aliança austríaca e dissolveu a Confederação Alemã.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Em 1848, a revolução varreu a Europa, durante um tempo conhecido como a "Primavera das Nações", quando trabalhadores de toda a Europa se levantaram contra os monarcas de longa data que os governavam. A Áustria não estava imune a esses ideais revolucionários, à medida que as notícias chegavam da França sobre as revoltas, os súditos do Império Austríaco se juntaram à oposição. Embora a revolução na Áustria não tenha sido bem-sucedida, ela contribuiu diretamente para a futura formação do Império Austro-Húngaro, à medida que o nacionalismo na Hungria se tornava cada vez mais potente e a insatisfação com o domínio austríaco se elevava. Em um acordo que veio a ser conhecido como o Compromisso Austro-Húngaro de 1867, o imperador austríaco Francisco José negociou a criação do Império Austro-Húngaro, mantendo o governo do Imperador Austríaco, mas permitindo à Hungria um parlamento independente e estrutura governamental.</Text>

Tendo suportado o fardo da guerra com Napoleão no século anterior, a infra-estrutura econômica e militar da Áustria foi grandemente enfraquecida pelo imenso conflito, e essa união fortaleceu a Áustria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os eventos que levaram à Iª Guerra Mundial, traçando suas raízes à Primeira e Segunda Guerras dos Bálcãs resultaram da contínua luta de poder entre a Áustria e a Hungria com a Rússia e a Sérvia pelo controle da região dos Bálcãs.

Um nacionalista sérvio chamado Gavrilo Princip foi responsável pelo assassinato, e apesar das tentativas de uma resolução diplomática, a Áustria-Hungria declarou guerra à Sérvia em 1914. No início da guerra, uma rede emaranhada de alianças e nações ligadas ao tratado entrou em ação. A Áustria-Hungria juntou-se a sua aliada mais próxima, a Alemanha, contra uma força unida liderada pela Rússia, que veio em defesa da Sérvia. A França aderiu ao conflito como um antigo aliado da Rússia, enquanto a Grã-Bretanha aderiu após a invasão da Bélgica pela Alemanha. Embora o conflito tenha começado como uma disputa entre a Áustria-Hungria e a Sérvia, o sistema estreitamente vinculado de alianças militares trouxe todas as principais potências do mundo para a luta.

			<Text>Existing for more than 1,000 years, the Byzantine Empire, centered in the legendary city of Constantinople, was initially formed as the eastern seat of power for the mighty Roman Empire. Located along the trade routes connecting Europe to Asia, Constantinople grew to become the primary trade hub in the region, flourishing despite the conflicts that led to the decline of Rome in the west. Inspired by a number of memorable rulers, the Byzantine Empire was also a source of great cultural growth along the eastern Mediterranean, its affluence allowing for grand displays of art, architecture, science, and music.</Text>

			<Text>Before the arrival of Constantine in 330 AD, the city of Constantinople was known as Byzantium, a small Greek colony founded in the 7th century BC. Strategically placed along the Bosphorus, the only waterway connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean (via the Marmara and Aegean Seas), this site would prove to be the ideal location for a larger settlement. Protected by water on three sides, Constantinople solidified a nearly impenetrable system of defense with the construction of its legendary walls. Despite the ebb and flow of territories controlled by the empire, the prosperity of the Byzantines could always be attributed to the wisely selected location of Constantinople. Today, the city is known as Istanbul, a megacity located in Turkey with a population of over 13 million people.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Outside of their renowned capital, the vast expanses of territory controlled by the Byzantines featured a diverse geography. At its peak, the empire primarily held regions surrounding the Mediterranean, featuring a subtropical climate with warm, humid summers followed by moderate winters.</Text>

			<Text>Throughout the early centuries of the new millennium, the Roman Empire continued its conquest of Europe and the Mediterranean unabated, consuming new territories faster than the Romans could properly administer them. Particularly on the eastern front, the Roman Emperor Diocletian saw the need for administrative reforms, seeking to improve both the economic stability as well as the defensive capabilities of these frontier territories. In roughly 285 AD, the system Diocletian devised, Tetrarchy, divided leadership of the Roman Empire among four rulers, with four frontier capitals. Nicodemia, the eastern Roman capital (today known as the city of Izmit, Turkey) would later be moved to Constantinople after Constantine I became emperor in 306.</Text>

			<Text>The early development of a distinct Byzantine Empire can be attributed directly to the efforts of the Roman Emperor Constantine I, who, in 330 AD chose the city of Byzantium as the settlement which would become the "Second Rome"- Constantinople. Intended to serve as the capital city of the Eastern Roman Empire (the "Byzantine Empire" being a name conceived of by modern historians), following the dissolution of Diocletian's tetrarchy, Constantinople's separation from Rome would prove to be more pivotal than expected.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With wealth came stability, and the Byzantine Empire, benefitting from its dominance of crucial trade routes, managed to avoid many of the conflicts that Rome itself could not. Relatively young as a city and geographically distant, Constantinople was far less of a prize to the raiders battering Rome during this period. However, the Byzantines were unable to escape the keen eye of history's greatest barbarian - Attila the Hun. These ongoing conflicts with the Huns proved to be troublesome for the Byzantines. Had Attila not died in 453, things might have turned out differently for the empire, as it is said that Attila was planning to return and conquer the kingdom once and for all, following his campaign in Italy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this period, the Western Roman Empire (Rome proper) had endured continual economic and military strife, and following the eventual fall of Rome itself to the increasingly powerful Germanic tribes, the Byzantine Empire would rise to succeed Rome, becoming one of the most influential kingdoms on the world's stage.</Text>

			<Text>The Justinian Dynasty, founded by Emperor Justin I in 518 and led shortly after in 527 by Justinian I, would see a period of reclamation for the Byzantine Empire, during which time many of the provinces lost by Rome during its decline were regained by Justinian. The Byzantine general Belisarius, who would also serve Justinian in crushing the infamous Nika revolt, led a number of successful campaigns against the Vandals and Ostrogoths during this period of reclamation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was during the Justinian Dynasty that Empress Theodora came to play an influential role in the empire. Wife and co-ruler to Justinian I, Theodora made her mark on history as a highly intelligent, trusted advisor to Justinian and an early advocate for the rights of women within the empire. It was Theodora's emphatic speech that guided Justinian through the Nika revolt, an uprising of rival political factions attempting to usurp Justinian's throne in 532.  It is said that while Justinian considered fleeing the city, Theodora implored him to remain, allegedly quoting an ancient saying "Royalty is a fine burial shroud." Justinian heeded Theodora's advice, ordering his general Belisarius to suppress the rebellion, leading to an eventual massacre at the Hippodrome that would secure Justinian's throne.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was also during the Nika revolts that the predecessor of the Hagia Sophia, a Christian church dating to the early times of Constantinople, was destroyed. The grand monument as it is today was constructed shortly after Justinian and Theodora quashed the revolt. Said to have been rebuilt using components gathered from across the empire, the Hagia Sophia features a number of innovative architectural elements and is considered a masterpiece of Byzantine architecture for its lavish decoration and grand scale.</Text>

			<Text>Throughout its history, and in particular during the rule of Justinian, culture within Constantinople flourished. Artisans and craftsmen labored to produce grand works of art throughout the city, displaying the influences of their Greek and Roman heritage, as well as the overwhelming authority of the Christian doctrines within the city. Christian art and icons would be revered within the empire for centuries, until the rise of iconoclasm, a backlash against the adulation of religious icons, in the 8th century AD. Although the spark that ignited such fierce iconoclasm within the empire is still debated today, it can be said with certainty that this response led to the destruction of many great works of religious art within Constantinople.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Byzantine architecture is another widely recognized aspect of the empire's storied history. As with Byzantine art, architecture within the empire was heavily influenced by religious motifs.  The Byzantines' study of mathematics, which influenced both their aesthetic design as well as their engineering capabilities, allowed for the construction of elaborate basilicas throughout Constantinople.  Most notably, the Hagia Sophia and the massive underground water storage chamber known as the Basilica Cistern were completed during the reign of Justinian I.</Text>

			<Text>During the 7-9th centuries AD, the Byzantine Empire was ruled by a number of short-lived dynasties. In the 7th century, Constantinople fell under the rule of the Heraclians, who struggled continuously with conflicts against the Arab Umayyad forces. The Arabs went so far as to lay siege to the city itself in 674, and although the defenses of Constantinople held, the city entered a period of decline with sharp reductions in its population. This would mark the beginning of the Arab-Byzantine Wars, during which time the Christian Byzantine Empire would be entangled in near constant war with the Islamic Caliphs controlling portions of Iraq, Syria and southern Italy. This conflict would continue sporadically for the next 400 some years, and the empire would suffer through some of its lowest points, before the resurrection of Byzantine power by the Macedonians in 867.</Text>

			<Text>During the reign of the Macedonian Dynasty (867-1057), the Byzantine Empire grew to perhaps its greatest heights, recovering from centuries of decline and once again entering a period of affluence and cultural expansion.  Beginning with the reign of Basil I, a growth in both economic prosperity and military power bolstered the empire, and the Byzantines managed a number of key victories over the Arabs and the Bulgarians, regaining lost territory in parts of Syria and the Balkans.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It would be these clashes with the Bulgarians in particular that would have the greatest effect on the future Byzantine Empire. As a result of the Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars, by 1018, the Byzantines had conquered Bulgaria and subjugated the Bulgars. The Bulgars would eventually become unlikely bedfellows to the Byzantines following the siege of the Fourth Crusade.</Text>

			<Text>Although the crusades are often seen as a direct response to the increasing power of the Islamic Arab states and the need to assist the Byzantines in thwarting them (as the primary Christian stronghold in the east), the crusaders didn't always target Constantinople's enemies. The Fourth Crusade was said to have been focused on taking control of Muslim-held Jerusalem, but instead the attackers moved to Constantinople, apparently still clinging to the events of the Great Schism of 1054, which isolated the Eastern Orthodox Church (Byzantines) from the Roman Catholic Church. In 1204, Constantinople was conquered by the crusaders, led by the Franks and the Venetians, and the city was relentlessly pillaged. The crusaders destroyed many of the Orthodox Churches and their relics, defiling them in ways said to have disturbed even the Pope, who had initiated the crusade in the first place. The events of the Fourth Crusade, creating both physical and political havoc within the Byzantine Empire, are said to have directly contributed to its downfall at the hands of the Ottoman Turks less than three centuries later.</Text>

			<Text>Following the sacking of Constantinople, most of the Byzantine territory was divided by the Franks and Venetians into a new domain, the "Latin Empire." However, Byzantine opposition still existed in the southern regions, and two Byzantine successor states were formed, the Empire of Nicea and the Despotate of Epirus. It would be the former, the Empire of Nicea, allied with the Bulgarians, which would eventually retake Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, leading to a short resurgence in Byzantine power.</Text>

			<Text>The decline of the Byzantine Empire, much like its counterpart in the Western Roman Empire, took place over the course of several centuries. Historians have long debated the roots of the Byzantines' fall from grace, crediting everything from the early Arab conquests and the Byzantine-Arab Wars, to the loss of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade as the pivotal event in the downfall of the empire. In any case, brief periods of resurgence were, seemingly without fail, always followed by newfound opposition and conflict.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the Byzantines struggled with civil war during the 14th century, the Ottoman Turks embarked on a number of successful military campaigns against the Venetians and Serbians, leading to an eventual showdown with the severely weakened Byzantine Empire. It is said that the last of the Byzantine emperors, Constantine XI Palaiologos, died in combat while defending the city walls during the Ottoman siege. The Ottoman Turks led by Mehmed II successfully conquered Constantinople in 1453 AD, marking the end of both the Byzantine Empire, and the final end to any remnants of the once great Roman Empire.</Text>

Ideally situated along the northern coast of Africa, Carthage became an increasingly crucial center of trade along the Mediterranean throughout the 1st millennium BC. However, this success was not without consequences, as Carthage eventually drew the ire of both Greece and Rome, and the ensuing conflicts with these intimidating rivals became the stuff of legend.</Text>

			<Text>The first settlers of Carthage came from the Kingdom of Tyre, part of the ancient Phoenician civilization. Retold over the centuries in both historical record and folklore, the story of Carthage's founding is intertwined with the legend of Dido, first queen of Carthage. Dido's cunning escape from Tyre and eventual settlement in North Africa serves as the liveliest account of the city's creation, although traditional historians accredit Phoenician colonists with the task.  There is little debate, however, that the city was first settled sometime around 814 BC, taking its name from the Phoenician "Qart-hadast," meaning "The New Town." In Dido's tale, she is said to have acquired the land from a local king, after he agreed to sell her as much land as she could cover with an ox hide. Dido quickly cut the ox hide into strips, which she then laid out to encircle a large hill and the surrounding area - the birthplace of Carthage.</Text>

			<Text>Founded among the prospering trade routes of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, it wasn't long before Carthage established itself as a formidable new empire in the region. As their forbearers in Phoenicia were conquered and dispersed during the 4th and 5th centuries BC, Carthage stood as the strongest of the remaining colonies, and soon held sway over all those once loyal to Tyre. Carthage's attempts to establish control over the surviving Phoenician colonies quickly brought them into conflict with Greece and Rome, who sought to claim the resource-rich lands of Sicily and southern Italy as their own.</Text>

			<Text>The increasing tension with Greece over control of Sicily led to a series of conflicts that came to be known as the Sicilian Wars. During the 7th century BC, Greece continued to expand its colonies in southern Italy and to the west in Sicily, as trade prospered, despite the growing rivalry with Carthage. Eventually, Carthage was forced to deal with the Greeks' continued encroachment into the territory that was once firmly Phoenician, not only to ensure a steady flow of income, but also to forcefully assert that Carthage would protect the remaining Phoenician colonies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although records of their skirmishes are limited, the Carthaginians primarily fought the Greeks on the island of Sicily itself. Initially Carthage simply aided the colonies in their individual efforts to resist Greek incursions, until open warfare erupted in 480 BC, when the Battle of Himera was fought on Sicily between the forces of Carthage under Hamilcar Mago and the armies of Greece led by Gelo, ruler of Syracuse. Although the details are unclear, Carthage was unceremoniously crushed by the Greek forces, allegedly suffering casualties in the hundreds of thousands. Hamilcar himself was killed, and, after just one great battle, Carthage was forced to withdraw, paying reparations to the Greeks in order to maintain control of their colonies in Sicily.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 410 BC, Carthage once again set out to defeat Greece and wrestle control of Sicily, this time under the leadership of Hannibal Mago, grandson of the previously defeated Hamilcar Mago. Hannibal Mago met with greater success than his grandfather, conquering several Greek controlled cities before eventually returning to Carthage. In 405 BC, Mago finally attempted to sweep across all of Sicily, but he and his army were sickened by the plague, and Mago himself died shortly thereafter.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] War with Greece continued throughout the 4th century BC, eventually culminating with the complete control of Sicily by Carthage.

			<Text>During the ongoing conflicts between the Greeks and Carthaginians, Rome moved to assert its dominance over the whole of Italy. By the 3rd century BC, Rome became embroiled in a conflict with the Greek state of Epirus, who came to the defense of Tarentum, an Italian colony involved in an increasingly tense diplomatic dispute with Rome.  After several Roman ships were sunk in the harbor of Tarentum, Rome declared war on the colony, which drew Epirus into the fight. The Greek ruler, Pyrrhus of Epirus, won several early battles against the Romans, including the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC. Rome sought reinforcements from Carthage, who agreed to create an alliance against the Greeks. Later at the Battle of Asculum in 279 BC, Pyrrhus was again successful in defeating the Roman army, but at a steep cost. Losing several thousand men in the conflict, this battle is the origin of the phrase a "Pyrrhic Victory," which came to mean a victory that comes at too great of an expense. Within five years time, Pyrrhus was forced to fully withdraw, and Rome's control of Italy was unquestioned. Carthage now stood alone as the biggest threat to Roman dominance of the Mediterranean.</Text>

			<Text>Not long after the conclusion of the Pyrrhic War, the continued expansion of Rome drew the ire of Carthage, as the two competitors fought not only for control of territory and trade, but also the prestige of being the dominant power of the region. A series of escalating clashes that came to be known as the Punic Wars erupted in 264 BC, when both powers became entangled in a local squabble over control of the Sicilian city of Messina. While the Romans excelled in land-based warfare, Carthage controlled the most intimidating navy of the time, and the Romans were forced to adapt to succeed against the Carthaginian fleet. By utilizing boarding platforms mounted on their ships, the Romans found a way to reassert their infantry skills while at sea. The First Punic War was concluded by 241 BC, with Carthage having suffered a number of serious defeats, allowing Rome's authority to climb unabated. Carthage was forced to pay Rome a hefty price for peace, leaving the country on unstable footing both economically and militarily.</Text>

In 240 BC, the unpaid mercenaries of Carthage who fought in the First Punic War took to arms and incited an uprising that quickly spread throughout the Carthaginian territories. During the ensuing conflict, Hamilcar Barca, father of legendary general Hannibal, valiantly led a limited Carthaginian force to victory over the rebels thanks in no small part to Barca's tactical genius.

			<Text>The Second Punic War began in 218 BC, again over a regional dispute, this time in the Greek city of Saguntum on the Iberian Peninsula (Spain). By this time, legendary general Hannibal had risen to the position of Commander of the Carthaginian military. After continuing quarrels over control of the city, Hannibal led his army to Iberia and besieged Saguntum. Hannibal succeeded in capturing Saguntum and established a base of operations there, which immediately led to a declaration of war by Rome.  In a surprising tactical maneuver, Hannibal made the decision to lead his army on an overland march to Italy, a monumental undertaking that stands as the hallmark of his campaign against Rome. In leading his army through the treacherous route, Hannibal hoped to invade Italy and catch the unsuspecting Romans off guard. As his force of more than 100,000 infantry and cavalry endured the grueling trek through the Pyrenees and then the Alps, many men were lost, and a number of prized war elephants fell to the bitter cold of the mountains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The forces of Rome and Carthage eventually met at the Battle of the Trebia in northern Italy late in 218 BC. Despite the loss of troops during his march to Italy, Hannibal successfully bolstered his force by recruiting tribes from Gaul, who were keen to fight their Roman antagonists. Although accounts differ as to the details of the battle, it can be said with certainty that Rome was thoroughly defeated, losing thousands of men despite having fielded a greater army than Carthage.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the war raged on, Hannibal was met with continued success, winning a number of early skirmishes before the Battle of Cannae, perhaps his greatest victory of the war. Fought near the village of Cannae on the southeastern coast of Italy, the battle was one of the largest of the war, as Rome attempted to counter Hannibal's push by fielding a massive number of legions. Unfortunately for Rome, throwing men into battle without proper direction provided no advantage, and Hannibal's tactics quickly overwhelmed the Romans. In a decisive blow, the Carthaginians ravaged the Roman columns, leading to casualties in the tens of thousands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following their demoralizing defeat at Cannae, the Romans began a campaign of attrition against Hannibal's forces, creating an eventual stalemate in Italy with neither side gaining additional ground. Although Hannibal was successful in capturing a number of colonies throughout Italy, the Romans had also made inroads in Iberia, conquering several crucial Carthaginian settlements there. The Romans' victories in Iberia revived their war effort, and under the leadership of Scipio Africanus, plans were laid for an invasion of Africa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hannibal returned to Carthage in 203 BC to face the impending threat from Scipio. Meeting at the Battle of Zama, Hannibal's depleted forces were outmatched by the freshly reinforced Roman army. Although Hannibal managed to escape from the battlefield with his life, much of his army was destroyed, and this defeat so close to home brought a quick end to the Second Punic War after more than a decade of near-constant strife.</Text>

Carthage had lost control of Iberia, and its standing on the world stage was greatly reduced. However, this was not the end of the longstanding rivalry, as the Third Punic War rose some 50 years later to settle the matter conclusively.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rome resumed the conflict in 149 BC, using petty regional frays as the justification for the final conquest of Carthage and its people. After making a number of unreasonable demands, perhaps knowing that Carthage would refuse, the Romans besieged the city for three years. Enduring until 146 BC, the beleaguered people of Carthage were eventually forced to surrender, Carthage itself was burned to the ground and much of the remaining population was slaughtered, the survivors sold into slavery. This marked the end of once great and powerful Carthage, one of the most formidable kingdoms of the ancient world, and perhaps the greatest rival the Romans ever faced.</Text>

Tendo sofrido brutalidade injustificada nas mãos dos romanos, Boadiceia liderou uma força unida de tribos das Ilhas Britânicas contra as legiões de Roma, a maior força de combate da época. Desde o saque de Roma pelo chefe celta Breno em 387 a.C. os romanos não viam tal assembleia de forças celtas, com o exército de Boadiceia chegando a centenas de milhares. Embora os romanos acabassem tendo sucesso em anular a rebelião (com perdas combinadas de ambos os lados, estimadas em mais de 100.000), como a história mostrara anteriormente, os romanos continuamente subestimavam o poder dos celtas e isso lhes custou caro.</Text>

			<Text>Os celtas da Península Ibérica (atual Espanha, Portugal e Andorra) eram migrantes da Gália. Tendo saído de suas casas no início dos séculos V e VI a.C., eles rapidamente se integraram à cultura ibérica existente na região. Os celtibéricos, como vieram a ser conhecidos, foram aliados de Cartago contra Roma durante a Primeira Guerra Púnica, decisão que contribuiria para sua eventual submissão pelos romanos, após a derrota do conhecido general cartaginês Aníbal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os celtibéricos eram conhecidos por construir o "Castro", um tipo de fortificação de pedra construída em toda a Península Ibérica.

Vivendo principalmente na região que hoje constitui a França, os gauleses foram descritos extensivamente por Júlio César em seu relato histórico das Guerras da Gália, o "Commentarii de Bello Gallico". Formados por dezenas de tribos individuais, os gauleses desenvolveram extensas rotas comerciais entre suas pequenas cidades, estabelecendo uma cultura que floresceria independentemente por séculos. Sua rica cultura seria quase obliterada, no entanto, pela eventual conquista dos romanos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Embora encontradas em todas as sociedades celtas da Europa, os druidas eram uma presença particularmente reconhecida entre os gauleses. Uma classe de sacerdotes muito apreciada entre os celtas, os druidas desempenharam vários papéis importantes na sociedade celta, atuando como juízes e estudiosos, além de sua posição tradicionalmente reconhecida como figuras religiosas.

			<Text>As the most advanced of the early Ethiopian kingdoms, the powerful Axumite Empire is well documented in history, but also steeped in legend. Founded in roughly the 4th century BC, Axum grew to become a powerful center of trade over the next five hundred years. The valuable commodities of frankincense and myrrh, harvested from trees prevalent in Ethiopia, brought great wealth to the city of Axum and its people. Through the exportation of these goods, plus lucrative trades in ivory and various precious metals, Axum became an integral part of the trade routes connecting Egypt, Rome, and India, enough so to facilitate the minting of currency within Axum to support the flourishing local economy.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, after centuries of prosperity, legends say the expansive empire's downfall came at the hands of a rebellious queen named Gudit. As the story goes, Axum had long been a stronghold of Christianity, and the Jewish queen Gudit sought the throne by way of conquest, purportedly devastating the countryside before murdering the royal family of Axum. Although the story of Gudit's life and brief reign is mysterious and controversial, it can be said with certainty that the decline of Axum did coincide with her speculated arrival in the 10th century AD.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Zagwe Dynasty, established in the early 12th century after the fall of Axum, was the first dynasty of the Ethiopian Empire, which would control the nation well into the 20th century. Although the Zagwe Dynasty was only in power for little more than a century, they contributed greatly to the spread of Christianity throughout Ethiopia, which would play a major role in the future of the country.</Text>

			<Text>In 1270 AD, the monarchy that would control Ethiopia for the coming centuries arose under the leadership of Emperor Yekuno Amlak, founder of the Solomonic Dynasty. The rulers of the Solomonic Dynasty attributed their lineage to the great biblical king Solomon and his queen, Makeda. As legend has it, in the 10th century BC, Queen Makeda travelled from her kingdom in Sheba (thought to have formed part of modern Ethiopia) to Israel in an effort to learn from the wisdom of revered king Solomon. Although accounts differ as to her relationship with Solomon, Makeda later gave birth to a son, Menelik. Said to have been educated in the court of Solomon before returning to Ethiopia, Menelik brought with him the legendary Ark of the Covenant as a gift from Solomon. Ruling sometime around 950 BC, Menelik I was the originator of the biblical ancestry held sacred by later Emperors of Ethiopia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nearly 2,000 years after the reign of Menelik, Yekuno Amlak claimed to have traced his ancestry through a long line of relatives to establish a clear connection to the legendary emperor and his parents. This newly formed Solomonic Dynasty maintained its rule over Ethiopia for more than five centuries, lasting until the reign of Haile Selassie in the 1970s. Fully supported by the influential Ethiopian Orthodox Church (which to this day still claims to be holding the legendary Ark of the Covenant), the Solomonic emperors enjoyed relative stability during their reign, despite several attempted incursions from outside the country.</Text>

As battles raged for nearly 15 years, Ahmad was nearly successful in wiping out the entire kingdom, laying claim to vast swaths of Ethiopian territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After suffering such great losses, the Ethiopian Empire was forced to call on the assistance of Portuguese reinforcements to help in repelling the Islamic armies.

After a prolonged conflict that eventually drew the Ottomans in to aid the Adals, the war was settled in 1543 following the deaths of both Imam Ahmad and the Portuguese general Cristovao da Gama.

			<Text>Early records of the Huns were far from impartial, having been written from the perspective of their numerous enemies, and leaving behind a spotty history of the Huns' initial conquests. Crossing into Europe in the 4th century, the Huns are said to have subjugated several rival tribes including the Alans, the Ostrogoths, and the Visigoths. While still only loosely united at this point, the Huns also boldly attacked portions of both the Eastern and Western Roman Empire, while also working as mercenaries for Rome against other tribes, successfully playing both sides of the field. It was during this period that the Byzantines (the Eastern Romans) began paying tribute to the Huns in order to secure peaceful relations, although the Romans often failed to meet their obligations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The history of the Huns becomes more certain in the time directly before the rule of Attila. Preceding him was his uncle Rua, who gradually established complete control over the diverse Hunnic forces and eliminated all opposing leadership. Rua maintained an iron-fisted rule over the Huns and launched a number of successful attacks against neighboring tribes before setting his sights on bigger objectives.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ruling as King of the Hun Confederation - as it became known at this point in history - Rua initiated a number of conflicts with the Eastern Roman Empire. It seems that several of the tribes previously subjugated by the Huns fled to the Byzantines in the hopes of seeking asylum. Rua, demanding they be turned over, set his armies loose on the Byzantine territory and pillaged Thrace, to the northwest of Constantinople. However, in the midst of his campaign, Rua was killed, allegedly after being struck by lightning, and the Huns were forced to retreat.</Text>

Sustained primarily by a steady income of tribute and plunder, the Huns became an increasingly powerful force on the European continent in the 5th century. The Roman General Aetius, who had previously allied with Rua and used the Huns to aid in securing his position as commander of the Roman troops in Gaul, again hired the Huns to serve as mercenaries in his campaign against the Burgundian raiders attacking the northern Roman provinces.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Flush with wealth, the Huns once again moved on the Eastern Roman Empire (a favored target of their campaigns) and intimidated the weakened Byzantine leadership into signing the Treaty of Margus in 435. This treaty was said to have doubled the previous tribute due from the Byzantines - which was already several hundred pounds of gold per year - further increasing the resources of the Huns. As was the case in the past, the Byzantines failed to meet their obligations and delivered no tribute, and as before, the Huns returned to the Eastern Roman territory and sacked a number of cities, eventually reaching Constantinople in 443. The Byzantines once again agreed to deliver substantial tribute, this time triple the original amount, and the Huns took them at their word and withdrew.</Text>

By 447, Attila had defeated the Eastern Roman armies and captured a number of Roman forts, gaining control of the Balkans. The Romans again tried to ply the Huns with tribute, and for a time, they actually paid it ... at least until Attila had focused his attention elsewhere.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 451, Attila invaded Gaul, attacking a number of cities en route to Orleans. Ironically, the Huns early benefactor, Roman General Aetius was now forced to face them head-on in defense of Gaul. Leading a combined force of Romans and Visigoths, General Aetius and his army met Attila at The Battle of Catalaunian Plains and managed to rebuff the Huns. Suffering the first major defeat of his career as a military commander, Attila was forced to withdraw from Gaul and regroup. Always the ambitious conqueror, Attila moved his forces east with the intention of striking Italy and the heart of the Romans.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sacking various cities in northern Italy, Attila never made his way to Rome. Although some historians believe it was the intervention of Pope Leo I who convinced Attila not to march further, others claim it was the threat of reinforcements from the Eastern Roman Empire that truly swayed his decision. Shortly thereafter in 453, Attila died unceremoniously on his wedding night, falling to, some historians claim, a simple nosebleed. Without the forceful leadership of the charismatic Attila and his legendary reputation, the Huns mystique as an unstoppable force was broken.</Text>

After his brother's death, Dengizich secured the throne for a brief rule, but the Huns, now in an increasing state of disarray, soon vanished from history as quickly as they had arrived.

Sustained primarily by their efforts as herdsmen and shepherds, the Huns kept a variety of livestock that provided mobile food sources as well as hides for clothing. They were also gifted archers who would hone their skills through frequent hunts, employing specially crafted composite bows that made them deadly to adversary and prey alike.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite their legacy as conquerors, the Huns also had skilled craftsmen and artisans among their people. A number of bronze artifacts attributed to the Huns have been found within the regions they once inhabited, including bronze cauldrons thought to have been used in Hunnic burial rituals.</Text>

			<Text>Primarily inhabiting regions of present-day Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize from the 3rd to 10th centuries AD, the Maya people lived in a network of independent kingdoms sharing a common culture and religion. While their true origin is shrouded in mystery, numerous theories exist as to the early development of Maya civilization. According to archaeological records, the first distinctly Maya settlements were established around 2000 BC. Growing from pre-agricultural communities into vast urban centers, the Maya city-states came to rely on sophisticated farming techniques for both sustenance and trade. Although many of their settlements suffered from an unexplained collapse late in the 1st millennium AD, numerous cities still thrived until the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors in the 16th century.</Text>

			<Text>Maya settlements were primarily found within Belize and Guatemala, along with the modern Mexican states of Quintana Roo, Campeche, and Yucatan, which comprise the region known as the Yucatan Peninsula. Consisting of mountainous highlands, lush wetlands and arid lowland regions, the Maya territory varied widely, from dense jungle to open plains.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tropical rainforests in portions of their territory provided the Maya with a diverse range of flora and fauna to supplement their agricultural production, while also providing access to fresh water that was otherwise scarce. Within the forest, annual rainfall amounts over 100 inches were not uncommon, and the waterlogged soil allowed for rain to gather into limestone sinkholes known as "Cenotes," pooling for easy collection.</Text>

			<Text>Various theories exist as to the origin of the Maya people, and it's only within the last 50 years that archaeologists studying Mesoamerica have managed to piece together a timeline of their early civilization. Breakthroughs in deciphering the Mayan script during the 1960s and 70s led to a revival in the study of Maya history, which had previously been mired in conjecture due to the lack of written records.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Maya civilization is categorized into several distinct cycles, the Pre-Classic, Classic, and Post-Classic periods. Beginning in the Pre-Classic period, the first settlements are thought to have formed between 2000-1500 BC, when the earliest Maya began to transition from a strictly hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a more community-focused agricultural subsistence. Over time these early communities would evolve into an increasingly complex society, not only implementing advanced agricultural practices and trade networks, but also creating grand works of art and architecture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The height of Maya civilization occurred from roughly 250 AD to 900 AD, during a time known as the Classic period. During the Classic period, the Maya developed some of their best known hallmarks, moving towards large independent city-states, each with vast urban centers teeming with monuments to their gods and kings.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Post-Classic period began with the decline of major urban centers throughout the southern Maya territory, an unexplained collapse that led to the complete abandonment of some of their greatest cities. However, many of the northern settlements continued to grow and prosper well into the new millennium.</Text>

			<Text>Although the immense cities of the Maya were united by a shared culture, they were also fiercely independent, invariably going to war with one another over territory, trade, and political disputes. Despite this independence, all of the great Maya cities shared a role in influencing their culture as a whole, as each contributed the unique characteristics that defined them as individuals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Believed to be the longest inhabited settlement found anywhere in the Americas, Kaminaljuyu was home to a large Maya population from roughly 1500 BC until about 1200 AD. Dozens of archaeological excavations at the site over the past century have revealed that the city may have been the primary producer of obsidian and jade in the region, and the remnants of more than 100 mounds and ancient structures have been discovered. Unfortunately, commercial construction and development of the surrounding area during the 19th and 20th centuries has all but destroyed the remains of this once great city, leaving only fragments behind.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El Mirador, flourishing from roughly 600 BC until 100 AD, was another great city of the Maya. A settlement of significant size, El Mirador is noted for its numerous elevated roadways, known to the Maya as the "Sacbe." Used to connect structures within the settlement complex as well as distant trade centers, the sacbe were a crucial mechanism in establishing the Maya trade networks. Similar to modern causeways that are raised over stretches of unstable land, the sacbe covered vast expanses, the longest connecting the ancient city of Coba with the smaller settlement of Yaxuna some 60 miles (96 km) away.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps the best known of the Classic Maya cities, Tikal, served as capital of the powerful Tikal state, an ambitious and aggressive state that often initiated fierce battles against its neighboring rivals. Tikal is thought to have been occupied for nearly 2,000 years, and was home to some 100,000 people at its peak. One of the lesser known innovations found at Tikal, the "Aguada," was an ingenious system of water reservoirs, designed to harvest and collect rain water funneled from the plaster walls of the city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chitzen Itza was one of the last surviving Mayan settlements, and as such it's also one of the best preserved of their cities. With extensive constructions covering an area over 2.5 sq. miles (6.5 sq. km), Chitzen Itza features prominent examples of nearly every form of Maya architecture including massive step pyramids, multiple ball courts, and ornately-decorated temples.</Text>

			<Text>Approaching the 9th century, many of the southernmost Maya settlements entered a period of swift decline for reasons still unknown today. Labeled the Classic Maya collapse, the dissolution and abandonment of these great kingdoms is the subject of controversy. Overpopulation, environmental damage, warfare and disease all stand as plausible theories on their own, but it seems most likely that within the larger city-states a combination of these factors led to their abandonment.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the mysterious collapse mainly effected the settlements in the southern Maya territory, many of the northern city-states continued to prosper well into the second millennium AD. Marking the beginning of the Post-Classic period, it wasn't until after the collapse that the famous city of Chitzen Itza first rose to prominence. Chitzen Itza survived for several hundred years before falling into a ruinous civil war with the neighboring Mayapan in the 1300s. Mayapan, along with Uxmal and Coba, were among the few remaining Maya cities in the north, post-collapse.</Text>

			<Text>Although the Maya were never unified as a single empire, instead living in city-states similar to the ancient Greeks, each independent state still followed a similar class structure. Beginning around the 3rd century BC, the Maya were ruled by hereditary succession, unless a suitable heir was unavailable. The king was joined by his family and other high ranking citizens to form the upper class of nobility. Beneath the nobles, the priestly class of shamans made up the next tier, guiding the Maya kings and leading the people through the many rituals and ceremonial rites undertaken throughout the year. Beyond these ruling classes, the majority of the Maya were simply the "common folk"-farmers, craftsmen, and laborers. Lower still, the underclass consisted primarily of slaves, who were prisoners of war and criminals.</Text>

			<Text>While working with limited access to fresh groundwater, the Maya utilized a number of agricultural techniques that allowed them to take full benefit of the rich soil within their domain. The "Milpa" system of crop rotation, known to have been used by a variety of Mesoamerican societies, was particularly effective for the Maya. A type of slash-and-burn farming, the Milpa system involved intercropping multiple species of vegetation together followed by periods where the fields were left fallow, or unseeded. Typically this rotation period allowed for two or three years of planting, followed by six to eight years without use. The crops of the Maya farmers were primarily corn, squash, and beans, known collectively as "The Three Sisters."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Maya were not only able farmers, but also skilled hunters and fishermen. Relying on a number of tools and weapons, the Maya primarily hunted deer, rabbit, and the "peccary," a pig-like creature found in the rainforest. The Maya also utilized an innovative spear-throwing device, the Atlatl, which they used for both hunting and warfare. Using a wooden shaft with a cupped end, the spear (or dart) would be laid along its length, and, using the thrower's natural motion, the spear would be propelled at a much higher rate of speed due to the additional extension provided by the device. Spears thrown from the Atlatl are said to be capable of reaching speeds over 100 mph (160 km/h), which allowed the Maya greater confidence in stalking larger, faster prey.</Text>

			<Text>Like other polytheistic societies throughout the world, the Maya worshipped a vast pantheon of gods, led by the creator god Itzamna. Special emphasis was placed on the sky gods, particularly Kinish Ahau, the sun god, and the moon goddess, Ixchel. The Maya also had gods for the weather, their crops, and the various professions in their society. The Maya maize god was of particular importance once the crop became a staple of survival during the later stages of their development.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Throughout the year, the Maya held a number of rituals honoring the gods, based largely on their knowledge of astronomy and the calendar.  Of the cultures that utilized human sacrifice, the Maya were far from the most prolific, but they did partake in bloodletting and sacrifice during their most important rituals. Human sacrifices were thought to have promoted fertility, and the Mayas were known to sacrifice humans by throwing them into freshwater sinkholes, honoring the rain god, Chaac. The famous Sacred Cenote, found at Chitzen Itza, was the site of numerous human sacrifices during the Classic period of Maya history.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Along with many other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya played a ritualistic ballgame where they attempted to knock a solid rubber ball (weighing 5-10 lbs) through a vertically mounted hoop using their hips. The game was played both recreationally and at ceremonial events, and was also used as a competitive means of settling territorial disputes, potentially resulting in the deaths of the losing team.</Text>

			<Text>At the height of their civilization, the Maya created many great works of art featuring intricate carvings and reliefs in stone and jade, as the artisans of each city incorporated unique regional characteristics into their work. The Maya also developed a range of pigments and dyes using the available resources of the jungle, most notably the color "Maya Blue," a vivid blue tone made from indigo dye that was later adopted into the works of the European colonists, following the decline of Maya society.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Among Maya architecture, its most recognizable aspect is the step pyramid, dozens of which were constructed during the later stages of their civilization. Just as it sounds, the step pyramid consisted of layers of stone built in stepped levels cresting in a flat peak where religious ceremonies often took place. It is thought that the Mesoamerican step pyramids were built upon existing burial mounds or earlier temples, and may have been rebuilt over time based on calendar cycles. The most prominent example of the Maya step-pyramid is found at the site of Chichen Itza in the Yucatan Peninsula, a well-preserved example under the stewardship of the Mexican government.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Maya writing system, made up of a script often referred to as glyphs or hieroglyphs because of its similarity to the ancient Egyptian writing system. Found inscribed on works throughout their territory and gradually deciphered over the past century, the Maya used this script to memorialize many aspects of their culture. Although there is evidence that Maya scribes created bound volumes using bark and animal skin, much of this work was destroyed during the colonial incursions of the Spanish in the 16th century, as it was thought to be as heretical.</Text>

			<Text>Of the many noteworthy aspects of the Maya culture, their calendar system has grown to become the most notorious of their advancements, mainly due to enduring theories about its true purpose. An impressively complex system, the Long Count calendar was one of three used by the Maya, the others being the Haab and the Tzolkin.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Source of the 2012 doomsday predictions, the Long Count calendar was used by the Maya as a historical record of time since the creation of the human world. By this calendar, civilization began on August 11th, 3114 BC, and, as selectively interpreted by those who choose to believe in our impending doom, ends on December 21st, 2012. These doomsayers believe that the Maya foretold the end of the world through the calendar, but most researchers simply interpret it as the end of one cycle and the beginning of another, not a cataclysmic end to the world as we know it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Used in conjunction with the Long Count calendar, the lesser-known Haab was a 365-day calendar that approximated a single solar-year, while the Tzolkin calendar followed a 260 day system used to judge harvest and ritual times.</Text>

			<Text>The arrival of the Spanish quickly led to the demise of the remaining northern Maya cities, and although the Maya people still exist today in Mexico and other parts of Central and South America, much of their culture and history was lost during the conquest of the Conquistadores. Beginning in the early 1500s, the Spanish sent expeditions into the Yucatan Peninsula in hopes of establishing a permanent settlement. However, the decentralized nature of the Maya city-states allowed for independent resistance to the Spanish incursions, and it would take the Spanish nearly 200 years to fully subdue the Maya people throughout the area.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the subjugation of the Maya, there were various attempts to convert the populace to Roman Catholicism by the Spanish. Of these efforts, the most notorious were those undertaken by Spanish bishop Diego de Landa, who served the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatan. De Landa is said to have held an inquisition in the small settlement of Mani, where he burned Maya idols as well as rare written codices, in an attempt to root out the native religion. Although his actions are widely viewed with disdain, De Landa is noted by some historians for keeping his own detailed records of the Maya religion and language as he observed it firsthand traveling among them.</Text>

However, none would leave a greater mark than the Spanish Habsburgs, whose persecution of Dutch Protestants under King Philip contributed directly to the outbreak of the Eighty Years' War. Pitting the Dutch citizenry against their Spanish masters in a near-century long conflict for independence, once free of Spanish rule, the people of the Netherlands worked tirelessly to establish their own national identity.

			<Text>Before the arrival of the Romans during the 1st century BC, the region of the Netherlands was inhabited by a wide range of Germanic tribes. Migrating from the surrounding areas, particularly Scandinavia, these tribes were also the early descendants of the Celts, who traced their origins to nearby Austria and Germany. Of these tribes, the Batavi, who lived on an island along the Rhine River, were among the most powerful and feared.

The Batavi eventually revolted against the increasingly restrictive Roman control, which led to their subjugation.

			<Text>Although written records of this period are scarce, following the decline of the Roman Empire, the territory the Romans once occupied within the Netherlands was quickly absorbed by the Franks and the Frisians. Although these tribal groups had lived throughout the area for centuries, with the absence of the once powerful Romans, the opportunity for their expansion was now greatly increased. The Empire of the Franks eventually encompassed nearly all of the Netherlands and Germany, except for the Frisian Kingdom situated along the northern coast. Living in such close confines, the Franks and Frisians eventually became bitter rivals, settling their territorial disputes through a series of wars. In 734, the Franks' victory at the Battle of the Boarn marked the dissolution of the Frisian Kingdom and their absorption into the Frankish Empire. The later conquest of Italy and the Frankish expansion under Charlemagne created the foundations of several future kingdoms, including those of France and Germany, under whose dominion the Netherlands fell in the coming centuries.</Text>

The majority of the Netherlands became part of the Middle Kingdom, under the rule of Lothair I. The division of the once vast empire also led to the creation of the Kingdoms of Germany (which would become the Holy Roman Empire) and France, both of whom battled for influence and territory within the Netherlands.  While much of the region would eventually fall under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire through the 15th Century AD, the Dukes of Burgundy, an offshoot of the French royal family, began to look towards the Netherlands with an eye for acquisition.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was also during this period that the first of many terrible floods struck the Netherlands, killing thousands and destroying much of the infrastructure within the country. In 1287, the disastrous St. Lucia's flood struck the Netherlands, killing over 50,000 people and turning a small lake into an inlet of the North Sea that was known as the Zuiderzee.

William was himself raised as a Protestant, but converted to Catholicism as part of his noble upbringing. Despite his religious views, he firmly believed that all people had the right to practice their own beliefs. As William was a Dutch nobleman, and served Spain as a loyal subject, he was initially hesitant to defy the king. However, when Philip made no attempt to appease the concerns of the Dutch, William's hand was forced.  By 1567, small rebellions were already underway, and by choosing to fund the uprising and turn his back on Philip, William was declared an outlaw by Spain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After William led his army to several victories in open warfare against Spain, in 1581 the Republic of the Seven United Provinces was created in the liberated northern territories. However, these initial successes only marked the beginning of a long conflict known as the Eighty Years' War, during which time the Spanish king remained in control of the southern Dutch territories. William of Orange was assassinated in 1584 by a Catholic follower loyal to king Philip, and the war raged on until 1648, when the Dutch Republic in its entirety was finally freed of Spanish control.</Text>

During the German occupation, the Dutch government fled the country and operated in exile, leaving the nation under the control of Nazi forces. Although a resistance movement within the Netherlands grew as the Nazi occupation became increasingly unbearable, the Nazis were still successful in killing thousands of Dutch Jews as well as Jewish exiles from Germany, including Anne Frank, whose diary has become a widely read chronicle of the Holocaust.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1944, in an effort to seize control of the bridges leading from the Netherlands to Germany over the Rhine and Maas rivers, the Allies launched one of the largest airborne missions in history, known as Operation Market Garden. The allies dropped thousands of paratroopers into the region, but the mission was met with limited success. Allied commanders blamed poor weather and communication issues with hampering the allied push. As a result, the Netherlands remained under the grip of the Nazi regime until the eventual surrender of German forces in the spring of 1945.</Text>

A Suécia tem um clima temperado geral que é surpreendentemente seco em comparação com as regiões vizinhas, embora haja variações climáticas distintas de norte a sul.

			<Text>Muito antes dos vikings, a Suécia era habitada por povos tribais que migraram pela região. Já em 12.000 a.C., caçadores-coletores que moravam na Suécia se mudaram com as estações do ano e acabaram formando pequenas comunidades de pescadores utilizando ferramentas primitivas de pedra e ardósia. Essas tribos primitivas desenvolveram sociedades agrícolas mais coesas, começando no período neolítico e continuando na Idade do Bronze Nórdica por volta de 1700 a.C. Um influxo de bronze importado permitiu o uso de ferramentas e armas progressivamente mais avançadas durante este período.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Com a aurora da Era Viking se aproximando no novo milênio, a Suécia era principalmente habitada por várias grandes tribos germânicas. Os "suecos" originais eram inicialmente apenas uma tribo singular vivendo em pequenos reinos e chefias em toda Svealand, o centro histórico do desenvolvimento sueco. Vizinhos pelos Geats ao sul e os Gutes na ilha de Gotland, no Báltico, os suecos acabaram se unificando com as tribos vizinhas, embora a data de sua unificação ainda seja um mistério. A colaboração desses primeiros reinos tribais ao longo da era Viking implica uma fusão gradual de seu território.</Text>

Durante os séculos VII e VIII, os vikings saíram da Escandinávia a cada primavera em busca de saques, retornando no outono carregados com espólios. Enquanto seus equivalentes dinamarqueses eram mais conhecidos por ataques na Inglaterra e na França, os vikings da Suécia atravessaram principalmente o Mar Báltico e as entradas do rio até a fronteira russa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mudando para a Rússia, Belarus e Ucrânia durante a invasão russa No século IX, muitos dos vikings suecos se estabeleceram nessas terras do leste, onde ficaram conhecidos como o povo Rus. Embora haja uma série de teorias sobre a origem de seu nome, a crença mais comum é que derivou da região sueca de Roslagen, que significa "Terra dos Remadores". Depois de capturar a cidade de Kiev em meados do século IX, o Rus formou um estado que sobreviveu por quase 400 anos até a chegada dos mongóis no século XIII. Essa "Terra de Rus" é notavelmente creditada como o nome da nação moderna da Rússia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Seguindo a longa tradição, os vikings suecos honraram suas vitórias mais históricas e reverenciaram líderes através do uso de pedras rúnicas. Inscritos com símbolos e glifos rúnicos, essas pedras monumentais fornecem alguns dos registros mais antigos das façanhas dos vikings e estão espalhadas por todas as regiões sobre as quais antes dominavam.</Text>

			<Text>De 1397 até 1523, a Suécia fazia parte da União de Kalmar, que efetivamente uniu a Suécia, a Noruega e a Dinamarca sob o domínio de um único monarca. Embora cada uma dessas nações fosse teoricamente independente, em termos de política externa e ação, as decisões do rei dinamarquês eram absolutas. O envolvimento da Suécia na união foi causado por conflito interno entre o então rei Albert e as lideranças nobres, que apoiara Albert durante sua sucessão até que ele tentou reduzir seus ativos e propriedades. Virando-se para a rainha Margaret da Dinamarca, a nobreza a nomeou regente de suas terras, e uma força de tropas dinamarquesas marcharam contra Albert, derrotando seus exércitos em 1389.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Encontrando-se na cidade sueca de Kalmar em 1397, a união foi oficialmente formada, sob a condição de que o monarca da união fosse sempre dinamarquês. A nobreza sueca concordou com a união baseado na promessa de Margaret de que sua influência e posse seriam protegidas, e que os suecos ocupariam posições de autoridade dentro do país, além do próprio trono. Um parente de Margaret, Érico da Pomerânia, foi coroado como o primeiro rei da nova união, mas suas próprias ambições rapidamente lançam dúvidas sobre as promessas feitas por Margaret.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dentro de 50 anos, a turbulência envolveu a união, pois os frequentes conflitos iniciados pelo rei dinamarquês contra os parceiros comerciais suecos enfureceram a nobreza sueca e prejudicaram a economia da Suécia. Em 1440, o rei Érico foi deposto, mas isso trouxe pouca paz à união. Os conflitos entre a Dinamarca e a Suécia transbordaram para o século XVI, até a ascensão de Gustavo Eriksson.</Text>

			<Text>O rei Gustavo I, também conhecido como "Gustavo Vasa", da Casa Vasa, liderou uma rebelião bem-sucedida em 1521 contra o rei dinamarquês Christian II, que governava a União de Kalmar. Livre das garras do monarca dinamarquês, Gustavo foi eleito rei da Suécia pelo Riksdag em 1523, pondo fim à união depois de mais de um século.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Foi o reinado posterior do estimado rei Gustavo Adolfo que verdadeiramente inaugurou a "Era da Grande Potência" da Suécia, uma ascensão dramática da autoridade sueca na Europa durante o século XVII. Ao assumir o trono em 1611, Adolfo encontrou-se nas rédeas de uma nação atolada em conflito. Seu pai, Carlos, tendo destronado o legítimo rei (e seu próprio sobrinho), Sigismundo, para obter a coroa, deixou a Suécia à beira de três guerras. Avançando habilmente nessas disputas domésticas e estrangeiras, Adolfo negociou uma paz frágil com Sigismundo, enquanto resolvia conflitos com a Rússia e a Dinamarca na década seguinte.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]O mais famoso dos feitos militares de Adolfo aconteceu durante a Guerra dos Trinta Anos, grande conflito que culminou com os defensores do protestantismo enfrentando as forças católicas do Sacro Império Romano. Sob Adolfo, o exército da Suécia foi reforçado e modernizado, e ele efetivamente protegeu o movimento protestante através de várias vitórias importantes na guerra. Embora não tenha sido envolvido desde o início, em 1630, Adolfo liderou os exércitos da Suécia em defesa dos estados protestantes alemães contra as forças do Sacro Império Romano. Lamentavelmente, Adolfo foi morto em 1632 enquanto liderava um ataque na Batalha de Lutzen, roubando da Suécia seu mais honrado general.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Manter o prestígio que a Suécia conquistou durante o reinado de Gustavo Adolfo não foi tarefa fácil, mas seus sucessores Carlos XI e XII eram líderes qualificados e respeitados. Continuando as melhorias militares iniciadas sob Adolfo, ambos os reis passaram a utilizar uma força especialmente treinada, conhecida como os Carolinos. O exército carolino enfatizou a qualidade em detrimento da quantidade, confiando na habilidade e disciplina ao invés da pura força de números.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Durante a Grande Guerra do Norte de 1700-1721, travada entre a Suécia e uma força unida liderada pela Rússia, os Carolinos superaram probabilidades intransponíveis, às vezes em desvantagem 3 a 1, e ainda saiu vitorioso em repetidas batalhas. Infelizmente, os suecos acabaram sendo superados pelas forças da oposição, levando a um retiro infame em 1718, conhecido como a "Marcha da Morte Carolina". Quando Carlos XII caiu em batalha, um oficial chamado Carl Armfeldt recuou com sua companhia de 5.000 homens, marchando precipitadamente para uma nevasca. Cerca de 3.000 homens morreram antes de o exército finalmente voltar para a Suécia.</Text>

The Huns purportedly massacred the populations of these cities, subjecting any survivors to a future of slavery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Sword of Attila, known as the "Sword of Mars" to the Romans, was the legendary weapon wielded by Attila that contributed to his renown as an invincible slayer of men. It was said that no man could look Attila directly in the eyes without flinching, his unflappable gaze proving too strong for even the most commanding of his rivals.

			<Text>Little is known of the early life of Attila before the death of his uncle Rua, who had led a loose confederation of Hunnic tribes north of the Danube River on various short-lived military campaigns. Attila and his brother Bleda took control of the Huns, sharing a dual kingship following Rua's death in 434.  Following in the footsteps of their uncle, the two kings initially launched attacks against the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) in hopes of generating a steady income of tribute. Unfortunately for both sides, the Romans often failed to keep their word, delivering little tribute and thus incurring swift and brutal reprisals from the Hunnic raiders. The saving grace for the Byzantines may have been Attila's western ambitions, where the Hunnic army occupied itself with fresh conflicts.</Text>

			<Text>The mysterious death of his brother Bleda in 445, some say by Attila's own hand, left Attila as the sole leader of an increasingly unified Hunnic force. In 447, Attila once again led his army into battle against the legions of the Eastern Roman Empire at the Battle of Utus, successfully defeating the Roman force, leaving little remaining opposition.  However, Attila's army suffered substantial casualties during the battle, which prevented him from seizing the Eastern Roman capital, Constantinople. Instead, Attila struck northward towards the Balkans (also Eastern Roman territory), sacking city after uncontested city, plundering everything his men could carry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After sweeping through the Eastern Roman Empire, Attila set his sights to the west. Moving swiftly across Europe, he launched successful attacks against the Visigoths throughout Gaul in 451-452. As the Hunnic horde marched onwards, many of the various tribal people they encountered joined Attila's force, some by choice, others compelled by intimidation. Regardless, the Huns were bolstered by these new recruits, and continued to pillage their way through the region until encountering a united Visigoth-Roman force on the fields of Gaul. At The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, Attila was turned back by the Roman-led force, the only major defeat in his lifetime, providing Rome and her allies a temporary reprieve.</Text>

Upon learning of her betrothal, Honoria attempted to contact Attila and gain his assistance in escaping the marriage.

For reasons that are unclear, Attila obliged (most likely due to lack of supplies). Shortly thereafter in 453, Attila died mysteriously. Some scarce evidence suggests that it may have been a simple nosebleed that toppled the mighty Hun on the night of his wedding, while other equally questionable accounts suggest he may have been assassinated.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Roman historian Jordanes wrote that Attila's men cut their hair and slashed themselves with swords to honor Attila in death, stating "The greatest of all warriors should be mourned with no feminine lamentations and with no tears, but with the blood of men."</Text>

			<Text>Boadiceia, lendária rainha guerreira da tribo dos Celtas  Icenos, é conhecida na história por dizimar uma série de assentamentos romanos enquanto liderava uma revolta de tribos celtas contra o poderio do exército romano que ocupava a Inglaterra no século I d.C. Embora os registros históricos deste período sejam limitados, baseando-se principalmente nos relatos dos historiadores romanos Tácito e Cássio Dio, a história da revolta de Boadiceia é geralmente aceita como algo assim:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]O marido de Boadiceia, Rei Prasutagus dos Icenos, há muito era um aliado dos romanos e mantinha um governo soberano sobre o seu povo durante a conquista romana da Bretanha. Após sua morte, ele teria nomeado Boadiceia e suas duas filhas como co-herdeiros, na esperança de manter os direitos e a nobreza de sua linhagem familiar. Com pouca consideração por seus velhos amigos, os romanos rapidamente se mudaram para anexar o território Iceno, e pode-se dizer com certeza que a brutalidade dos romanos na questão era inabalável. Boadiceia foi publicamente açoitada.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]O ultraje suscitado pelo desrespeito e brutalidade dos romanos em relação aos Icenos levou Boadiceia e seu povo a organizar uma rebelião com a ajuda de tribos vizinhas, particularmente dos Trinovantes. Boadiceia reuniu uma força enorme, estimada em 70.000 ou mais, e marchou para a colônia romana de Camulodunum. Os romanos, despreparados para um ataque tão vasto, foram pegos de surpresa e não encontraram piedade nas mãos da rebelião. A cidade de Camulodunum foi sitiada e destruída, e o exército rebelde procedeu ao lado da cidade de Londinium, destruindo tudo de valor para os romanos em seu rastro. Verulamium foi a terceira e última cidade esmagada durante a revolta de Boadiceia, incendiada, e os cidadãos romanos foram massacrados. Ao todo, o exército de Boadiceia teria matado mais de 80.000 romanos e britânicos pró-romanos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Encontrando-se em um local desconhecido na Inglaterra em 61 d.C., o exército romano e suas legiões reunidas finalmente enfrentaram a força da rebelião tribal de frente. Infelizmente para Boadiceia, o extenso treinamento e táticas dos romanos seriam o final da insurreição. Dizem que mulheres e crianças, acompanhando os vagões de suprimentos rebeldes, vieram observar a batalha e dar apoio. A presença desses observadores no campo, entretanto, deixaria os rebeldes com pouco espaço de manobra. A revolta foi esmagada e cerca de 70.000 a 80.000 rebeldes foram mortos na batalha que se seguiu e depois. Acredita-se (embora não exista nenhum meio de confirmação) que Boadiceia tenha morrido por sua própria mão algum tempo depois da batalha, a teoria mais comum sendo que ela consumiu veneno para evitar a captura.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_BOUDICCA_TEXT_2">
			<Text>Embora seja difícil julgar uma figura lendária como Boadiceia, podemos dizer com certeza que a revolta que ela liderou contra os romanos foi enraizada em uma causa justa, revidando a ocupação e a brutalidade insuportável que os romanos infligiram ao povo celta. Embora os rebeldes sob a liderança de Boadiceia tenham matado soldados e cidadãos romanos da mesma forma, a história não julga suas ações como inescrupulosas, tendo visto também os modos dos impiedosos romanos. Embora existam poucos detalhes da vida de Boadiceia antes da rebelião, seu legado como uma nobre guerreira, que morreu para defender as liberdades de seu povo, viverá na história por muito tempo.</Text>

			<Text>The story of Dido, Queen of Carthage, is, as most legends are, filled with intrigue and deception. Retold through the words of Roman historians and later the esteemed poet Virgil in his epic the Aeneid, Dido's tale begins with her life as the daughter of King Mattan of Tyre.  The Kingdom of Tyre was part of the ancient Phoenician civilization, geographically located in what is today modern Lebanon. Dido, who was often referred to as "Elissa" in the ancient historical records, was heir to the throne of Tyre following her father's death, sometime around 800 BC. Named joint-ruler with her brother, Pygmalion, Dido's rule was not widely accepted by the people. Despite her father's intention for her to share the throne with her brother, Pygmalion was recognized as King of Tyre, and Dido was left with little authority.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Not long after, Dido was married to a priest named Acerbas, who, by some accounts may have been her uncle. Acerbas is said to have been possessed of considerable wealth, which he concealed by burying his treasures underground. King Pygmalion, knowing of this wealth, had Acerbas murdered in hopes of claiming the gold that would rightfully go to his sister. Although accounts vary, Dido eventually became aware of her husband's death at the hands of her brother. The ghost of Acerbas himself is said to have appeared before her one night and warned her to flee the kingdom, while at the same time revealing the location of his hidden gold. It was the careful formation of her plan to escape Pygmalion's grasp that provided history's first glimpse of the clever nature for which Dido was best known.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In order to keep from arousing her brother's suspicions, Dido told Pygmalion she wished to travel the world, with the intention of sending tribute and gifts back to Tyre. Agreeing to her trip, Pygmalion provided Dido with a small fleet of ships and various servants to help her prepare for the journey. After quietly loading the ships with bags of gold from Acerbas' hoard, Dido set her plan in motion. In order to deceive Pygmalion, Dido ordered the servants to load bags filled with sand on to the upper decks, to be used as decoys. After setting sail, Dido declared the gold to be an offering to the spirit of her dead husband, and had the bags of sand thrown overboard into the sea. Pygmalion, thinking the gold was lost forever, made no attempt to pursue Dido or her party.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now searching for a new home, Dido and her party first stopped on the island of Cyprus, where a group of local stragglers joined her crew. Eventually they made landfall along the coast of northern Africa, and began negotiating a price with the local chieftain for a small piece of land on which to found their new settlement. As the agreement went, Dido could have as much land as she could encompass with a single ox hide, with the local leader believing he was getting quite a deal. The quick-witted Dido conceived of another angle on the proposal; by cutting the ox hide into thin strips, then into even smaller fibers, she created a length of rope long enough to encircle a wide area including a prominent hill nearby. Thus, the city of Carthage was founded, and Dido's legacy as a crafty and capable leader was sealed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Dido ruled Carthage as its first queen, and, as the legend continues, was eventually the object of several suitors, including the Trojan prince Aeneas. In Virgil's account, Aeneas was brought to Carthage through the manipulative workings of the Greek gods. Dido and Aeneas became lovers, and when Aeneas left Dido to continue on his journey, Dido was so distraught that she committed suicide.</Text>

			<Text>O Reverenciado rei sueco e comandante militar Gustavo Adolfo, conhecido como "O Leão do Norte", ascendeu ao trono aos 17 anos e rapidamente estabeleceu sua reputação como um estrategista militar qualificado e um inovador na arte da guerra. Herdando uma complexa teia de conflitos internos e externos de seu pai, o rei usurpador Carlos IX, Adolfo não perdeu tempo em formar alianças com a outrora hostil nobreza, esmagando os inimigos da Suécia e levando sua nação ao alto escalão do poder na Europa durante o século XVII.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_GUSTAVUS_ADOLPHUS_TEXT_2">
			<Text>Grande parte da turbulência que aguardava Adolfo em sua sucessão foi o resultado direto do breve período de seu pai como rei. Na época do nascimento de Adolfo, seu pai era o Duque Carlos, servindo como regente da Suécia no lugar de seu sobrinho, o rei Sigismundo da Polônia. Enquanto Rei da Polônia e Grão-Duque da Lituânia, Sigismundo também era o legítimo Rei da Suécia, filho do rei sueco anterior, João III. No entanto, a essa altura da história, a Suécia era um estado de maioria protestante, com Carlos sendo um protestante vocal, enquanto Sigismundo era um católico devoto. Temendo o potencial retorno forçado da Suécia ao catolicismo, uma união pessoal entre a Suécia e a Polônia foi formada em seu lugar. Compartilhando o mesmo rei - mas independente na lei e na cultura - essa união permitiu que o duque Carlos liderasse como regente a Suécia enquanto Sigismundo permanecia na Polônia, separando as facções religiosas opostas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Como regente, Carlos era visto como um protetor de crenças protestantes, e ele usou a tensão religiosa crescente para sua própria vantagem. Exercendo sua própria autoridade sobre os governadores regionais na Suécia ainda leais ao rei, Carlos incitou uma guerra civil com os seguidores de Sigismundo. Após uma série de breves conflitos, a situação culminou na Batalha de Stangebro em 1598, quando o exército invasor de Sigismundo foi derrotado. Capturado e retornado à Polônia, Sigismundo ficou com pouco apoio na Suécia. Em 1600, o Riksdag, conselho parlamentar da Suécia, reconheceu que Sigismundo abdicou do trono e nomeou Carlos como Rei da Suécia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os eventos que levaram à coroação de Carlos teriam um impacto duradouro no futuro reinado de Adolfo. Não só a união pessoal entre a Polônia e a Suécia foi rompida, mas Sigismundo manteve sua reivindicação ao trono da Suécia e recusou-se a encerrar sua busca da coroa perdida. Como resultado, um estado quase constante de guerra entre as duas nações seguiu pelos próximos 50 anos.</Text>

			<Text>Enquanto Carlos é creditado com a proteção das crenças protestantes do povo sueco, seu direito à realeza era duvidoso na melhor das hipóteses. Depois de liderar a Suécia por apenas sete anos, Carlos morreu em 1611, deixando seu filho para suportar o fardo de seu tumultuoso reinado. Adolfo, que já tinha servido com seu pai nas forças armadas durante os anos anteriores, foi coroado rei aos 17 anos. Imediatamente após sua ascensão, ele procurou sufocar as preocupações da nobreza sueca, cujo envolvimento e autoridade em governar através do Riksdag foi reduzido sob Carlos. De acordo com os regulamentos do parlamento, Adolfo era jovem demais para se tornar rei aos 17 anos. No entanto, um acordo foi alcançado, Adolfo se tornou rei, e em troca ele concedeu à nobreza assentos em seu Conselho Privado, um coletivo dos conselheiros mais próximos do rei.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Adolfo enfrentou conflitos de três rivais distintos, com crescente tensão da Dinamarca e da Rússia, coincidindo com a contenda em curso envolvendo Sigismundo e Polônia. Com o potencial de guerras em três frentes, Adolfo rapidamente se moveu para aliviar alguns dos compromissos militares da Suécia. O conflito em curso com a Polônia e Sigismundo foi resolvido com uma trégua em 1611, uma paz que era renovada a cada ano enquanto os dois lados lidavam com tumultos em outros lugares.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]O conflito de Kalmar foi causado pelas tentativas da Suécia de reivindicar a região de Finnmark, na Noruega, permitindo que os comerciantes suecos contornassem o imposto dinamarquês incidente sobre aqueles que passavam pelo estreito ligando o Mar Báltico ao Mar do Norte. Dependendo pesadamente desses impostos, e temerosos de os suecos desenvolverem uma rota comercial alternativa, os dinamarqueses declararam guerra à Suécia em 1611. O esforço sueco foi inicialmente liderado por Carlos, que morreu logo depois e deixou Adolfo com poucos meios para vencer a guerra. Após dois anos de conflito e a perda de várias fortalezas suecas, a guerra foi finalmente resolvida em 1613 com a Paz de Knared. Embora a Suécia pagasse um preço alto para recuperar suas fortalezas perdidas, eles conseguiram obter uma isenção de qualquer imposto futuro ao passarem pelo estreito.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A Guerra Ingriana com a Rússia surgiu em 1610 das tentativas de Carlos de ganhar o trono da Rússia por seu outro filho, Carlos Philipe. A morte de Carlos logo após o início da guerra deixou Adolfo para resolver o conflito. Batalhas travadas em toda a Rússia por sete anos, com ganhos e perdas para ambos os lados, contrariando qualquer progresso real. A guerra foi concluída em 1617 com a assinatura do Tratado de Stolbovo, com o que a Suécia ganhou várias províncias, mas também devolveu parte do território adquirido em conquista. A Suécia também reconheceu Michael Romanov como o legítimo czar da Rússia como parte do acordo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Esses primeiros conflitos proporcionaram a Adolfo a oportunidade de aprimorar suas habilidades como rei e comandante. Aprender os caminhos da diplomacia e da guerra desde tenra idade proporcionou a Adolfo uma valiosa experiência, preparando-o para as maiores batalhas que se avizinham em seu futuro.</Text>

			<Text>Pelo acordo alcançado sobre sua sucessão, Adolfo concedeu maior autoridade ao conselho do Riksdag, elevando seu status de um corpo cerimonial para um conselho governante que poderia convocar a seu próprio comando e tomar decisões impactando a política nacional. Como resultado, Adolfo formou uma estreita relação de trabalho com Axel Oxenstierna, um nobre que ele nomeou Alto Chanceler do Conselho Privado. Através da orientação cuidadosa de Oxenstierna, muitas das políticas domésticas mais notáveis de Adolfo foram formadas. Entre suas realizações mais notáveis, em 1617, o estabelecimento de quatro "propriedades" claramente definidas dentro do Riksdag - consistindo da nobreza, o clero, os burgueses e o campesinato - assegurou que cada membro da sociedade sueca recebesse uma participação e um voz no palco nacional.</Text>

			<Text>Entre os muitos nomes dados a Gustavo Adolfo por seus colegas e historiadores, sua reputação como "O Pai da Guerra Moderna" vem das táticas e armamentos militares pioneiros desenvolvidos durante seu reinado. Inúmeras inovações ainda em uso pelos modernos exércitos foram concebidas por Adolfo, incluindo a artilharia leve móvel, formações variadas com tipos de tropas mistas e táticas ofensivas agressivas que contrariavam as estratégias defensivas formais empregadas durante seu tempo. Adolphus é notavelmente creditado como um dos primeiros a equipar seus homens com cartuchos de armas de fogo, combinando quantidades pré-medidas de pólvora com o projétil em um cone de papel. Ao eliminar a necessidade de medir e despejar pólvora enquanto estava no campo, Adolphus aumentou tanto a confiabilidade quanto a velocidade das armas de seus homens.</Text>

			<Text>O coração do legado de Adolfo era sua habilidade de comandar no campo de batalha, e ele era natural, aprendendo os caminhos da guerra durante seus primeiros anos de adolescência enquanto seu pai ainda era rei. Adolfo foi ferido várias vezes em batalha, incluindo uma  bala de mosquete entrincheirada perto de seu pescoço. Nunca recuando de seus deveres, Adofo seguiu em frente com a ferida, lutando em várias batalhas enquanto usava apenas uma couraça de couro flexível para aliviar a dor causada a ele usando uma pesada armadura de ferro.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Numerosas batalhas travadas pela Suécia sob seu olhar atento, seu mais notável veio durante a Guerra dos Trinta Anos. Primariamente um conflito entre os estados protestantes e as forças católicas que serviam ao Sacro Império Romano, a Guerra dos Trinta Anos foi um conflito altamente destrutivo que deixou uma marca indelével na Europa. Embora vários fatores tenham levado ao início dos combates em 1618, a Suécia permaneceu neutra até 1630, quando Adolfo achou por bem ajudar os protestantes alemães e defender a Suécia das ambições em expansão do Sacro Imperador Romano-Germânico. Liderado por Adolfo e seu grito de guerra "Gott Mit Uns!", significando "Deus está conosco!", os exércitos da Suécia tiveram uma série de sucessos, esmagando as forças católicas e retardando seu avanço.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Talvez seu confronto mais famoso, conhecido como Batalha de Breitenfeld, tenha sido travado em 1631 na Saxônia (atual Alemanha). Com o uso efetivo da artilharia móvel e uma série de manobras astutamente programadas lideradas pela cavalaria ligeira finlandesa, as "Hakkapeliittas", Adolfo e seu exército esmagaram as forças imperiais, capturando as posições de artilharia inimigas e usando suas próprias armas contra eles. Um triunfo completo e absoluto para as forças protestantes unidas, a vitória em Breitenfeld cimentou a reputação de Adolfo como um líder capaz e inimigo perigoso para o Sacro Império Romano-Germânico.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pouco depois, na Batalha de Lech, na Baviera, em 1632, Adolfo liderou um exército de 40.000 soldados suecos contra um contingente menor de forças católicas lideradas pelo conde Johan Tzerclaes. Sob a cobertura do apoio de artilharia móvel, Adolfo enviou seus Hakkapeliittas através do rio Lech usando pontes temporárias. Uma vez cruzadas, as unidades de cavalaria de elite se aproximaram e criaram uma posição defensiva permitindo que o restante do exército cruzasse. Adolfo rapidamente liderou um ataque contra as forças católicas e Tzerclaes foi ferido, morrendo depois de seus ferimentos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A batalha final de Adolfo viria em Lutzen, Alemanha, no final de 1632, quando ele foi separado de seus homens enquanto liderava um grupo pela fumaça densa, e foi morto a tiros. Desconcertados pela perda de seu grande rei, as fileiras suecas logo ficaram em caos, mas de alguma forma ainda conseguiram forçar a retirada do exército imperial. Embora a Suécia tenha sofrido várias derrotas após a morte de Adolfo, pela assinatura da Paz da Westfália em 1648, que encerrou a Guerra dos Trinta Anos, a Suécia emergiu como uma das nações mais fortes da Europa, devido em grande parte à brilhante liderança de Gustavo Adolfo.</Text>

Embora seu pai tenha deixado um legado de conflitos para Adolfo resolver, ele agiu à altura e elevou o Reino da Suécia ao auge do poder militar e político.</Text>

			<Text>A ascensão de Maria Teresa ao trono dos Habsburgo foi repleta de controvérsia e tumultos desde o início. Seu pai, o rei Carlos VI, não tinha filhos e, como tal, não tinha herdeiro legítimo ao trono, de acordo com as leis de sucessão existentes. Em um esforço para manter sua linhagem real e assegurar que Teresa governaria como rainha, Carlos emitiu a Sanção Pragmática de 1713, declarando sua intenção de passar a coroa para sua filha. Embora o edital tenha sido reconhecido por algum tempo, após a morte de Carlos em 1740 e a coroação de Teresa, forças lideradas pela França e pela Prússia desafiaram seu direito ao trono e iniciaram a Guerra da Sucessão Austríaca. Apoiada pela Grã-Bretanha, Teresa foi inflexível em sua resistência a entregar o trono ou território austríaco aos seus rivais. Infelizmente, seu pai deixara o império em uma posição instável, com um tesouro exaurido que tornava impossível reforçar suas forças armadas, pequenas e mal equipadas. Após quase oito anos de combates, durante os quais a Áustria sofreu várias derrotas esmagadoras e foi forçada a ceder o território rico em minérios da Silésia à Prússia, o Tratado de Aix-La-Chapelle finalmente encerrou a guerra. Embora Teresa estivesse agora segura em seu governo do domínio dos Habsburgos, a rivalidade da Áustria com a Prússia estava apenas em sua infância, com uma luta ainda maior por vir.</Text>

			<Text>Tradicionalmente, o soberano do domínio Habsburgo Austríaco era também o soberano do Sacro Império Romano, uma designação conferida pelo Papa. Entretanto, como era o caso com sua ascenção ao trono Habsburgo, leis da época ditavam que uma mulher não poderia ser eleita Sacra Imperatriz Romana. Para contornar esta norma, Maria Teresa nomeou seu marido, Francisco Estêvão, como co-soberano de suas terras na Áustria e Hungria, permitindo que ele fosse nomeado Sacro Imperador Romano e ela sua imperatriz consorte. Embora essa posição de consorte normalmente implicasse em uma posição de menos autoridade, Francisco Estêvão se curvava à sabedoria e orientação de Maria Teresa, que lidava com todos os assuntos de governo pessoalmente.</Text>

			<Text>As hostilidades renovadas entre a Áustria e a Prússia levaram à eclosão da Guerra dos Sete Anos em 1756, com deslocamento de alianças pesando fortemente no resultado. Em um evento conhecido como a Revolução Diplomática, a Grã-Bretanha aliou-se agora à Prússia, enquanto a França mudou sua lealdade à Áustria. Esse reverso das alianças surgiu quando as prioridades nacionais mudaram, com a Grã-Bretanha encarando o poderoso Reino da Prússia como o aliado mais forte contra seu rival tradicional na França. O território da Silésia foi mais uma vez o foco principal do conflito, com Maria Teresa tentando desesperadamente recuperar a valiosa região perdida durante a guerra pela sucessão. Apesar de seus melhores esforços, a Áustria novamente não conseguiu recuperar a Silésia, com o Tratado de Hubertusburg em 1763 marcando o fim da guerra e reafirmando o controle prussiano do território.</Text>

Tributando a nobreza e os membros do clero, que antes estavam isentos de impostos, os esforços de Maria rapidamente melhoraram a economia vacilante da Áustria.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Com a segurança econômica, Maria dirigiu seu Supremo Chanceler, Conde Frederico Guilherme von Haugwitz, a ampliar e modernizar o exército da Áustria.

			<Text>Commonly known as "Pacal the Great," the Mayan king K'inich Janaab' Pakal is perhaps the most renowned of all Mayan rulers. Ascending to the throne at the tender age of 12 and ruling for nearly 70 years thereafter, Pacal inherited the city-state of Palenque during a time of great turmoil. Although the historical details surrounding his reign are often hazy, Pacal is best known for reinvigorating the ravaged city, which had been sacked repeatedly during the rule of his predecessors. Leading a vast construction effort, Pacal oversaw the creation of immense and remarkably detailed structures throughout his domain. Most famously, Pacal's burial tomb, known as the Temple of Inscriptions, features an intricately carved history of the king's life presented in Mayan glyphs. With an astonishing number of well preserved inscriptions, the temple has given contemporary archaeologists crucial insight into the once lost history and culture of this great Mayan city.</Text>

			<Text>Pacal's mother, Lady Zac-Kuk, was one of few women to ever rule independently over a Mayan city-state. Typically the crown was only passed on to the son of a king, but in the absence of a suitable male heir, leadership was bestowed upon Lady Zac-Kuk, who asserted her right to the throne as the granddaughter of a past queen. Ruling for 3 years until Pacal came of age, this unusual deviation in the traditionally patriarchal society led directly to the later efforts of Pacal to legitimize his reign and the rule of his family line.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When Pacal did take the throne in 615, the city of Palenque was in a tumultuous position, having been the target of frequent incursions from the neighboring kingdom of Calakmul in the preceding years. Making a clear statement to Palenque's rivals early in his reign, Pacal sent his own raiding parties against the Calakmul, capturing several of their leaders and sacrificing them in retribution for the attacks.</Text>

			<Text>With the intention of both returning Palenque to its former glory, and also establishing the legitimacy of his rule, Pacal initiated the construction of grand monuments throughout the city, with reliefs extolling the virtues of his family line. A number of impressive structures were built, including the Temple of the Count and the large central complex known simply as "The Palace," featuring a peculiar four-story tower unlike any seen throughout the Mayan realm. Yet, of the many edifices assembled during his reign, none surpassed the Temple of Inscriptions. Built to serve as Pacal's burial tomb, construction began on the stepped pyramid during the final years of his life and continued under his successor, Chan Bahlum II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Featuring intricate carvings and hieroglyphic text, the temple is best known for housing Pacal's ornate sarcophagus. First discovered by Mexican archeologists in 1952, the walls of Pacal's tomb in the lower level of the temple contain the longest set of Mayan glyphs ever found. Although still the subject of interpretation today, the glyphs appear to chronicle the events of Pacal's life leading up to his death and the ascension of his heir.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The sarcophagus itself features an elaborately detailed stone lid with glyphs representing the planets and several constellations. These celestial elements in particular have contributed to controversial theories regarding the involvement of extraterrestrials in the Mayan culture, similar to theories surrounding the ancient Egyptian pyramids. While most esteemed researchers believe the sarcophagus depicts Pacal's journey to the underworld, other sources interpret this imagery as Pacal at the controls of a spaceship preparing for launch. Inside the sarcophagus, archaeologists discovered the skeletal remains of Pacal, wearing a finely crafted jade mosaic in the form of a mask.</Text>

			<Text>Pacal the Great is considered by historians to be one of the most revered leaders in Mayan history, based on the remarkable monuments and sculptural creations found throughout Palenque. In his time as king, nearly 1000 structures were assembled in the city, requiring stones that weighed up to 15 tons. Although his past is still being uncovered today, we can say with certainty that his efforts to restore the kingdom of Palenque led to the assembly of some of the greatest monuments and art ever created by the Maya.</Text>

			<Text>Known as the "Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah," "King of Kings," and "Elect of God," Haile Selassie ruled Ethiopia as emperor for nearly 40 years in the 20th century. Born as Lij Tafari Makonnen in 1892, the man who came to be known as Haile Selassie spent his life serving the interests of Ethiopia and bringing his nation to the forefront of African politics. Best known for reforming the ancient feudal practices of Ethiopia through his attempts at modernizing the nation, Haile Selassie worked tirelessly to gain international recognition for Ethiopia on the world stage. His legacy in global politics has been surpassed only by his role as the messiah of the Rastafari religion, among whose followers he is venerated as the god who will lead the Rastas back to their homeland of Ethiopia.</Text>

			<Text>As the son of a provincial governor, Haile Selassie spent his formative years under the tutelage of several mentors selected by his father, including an influential monk named Abba Samuel. As his education continued, Selassie was seen fit to rule as governor of several minor provinces, and by age 17, had already established himself as a rising political star. During his time as governor, Selassie emerged as a progressive thinker among his peers, introducing policies that reduced the feudal control of the nobles by increasing the authority of the central government.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1916, Haile Selassie was named Regent Plenipotentiary, serving under Empress Zewdito, placing him in the position of heir apparent to the throne. With both conservative and progressive supporters alike, Selassie was the ideal regent. However, over the course of his appointment, Selassie's support among the progressives throughout Ethiopia continued to grow, much to the chagrin of the conservative Empress. Although Empress Zewdito was the nominal leader of Ethiopia, as regent, Selassie handled much of the government's administration himself. During this period, Selassie is credited with ensuring Ethiopia's membership in the League of Nations, an inclusion that came about as a result of his efforts to abolish slavery in Ethiopia.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_SELASSIE_TEXT_3">
			<Text>As Haile Selassie's influence and popular support continued to climb, the Empress was forced to confront the would-be ruler. In 1928, Empress Zewdito attempted to remove Selassie from office by accusing him of treason, but her efforts found little backing. Selassie's popularity at this point was widespread, and he garnered a great deal of support from within the military, leaving Zewdito with little means to assert her claims. As a result of the confrontation, Zewdito was forced to name Haile Selassie King of Ethiopia, a title beneath her own, but still acknowledging his increasing authority within the nation. Less than two years later, the Empress died of unexplained causes, leaving the throne of Ethiopia vacant for Selassie to claim as his own. It was following his coronation as emperor in 1930 that he first came to use the name Haile Selassie, which meant "Power of the Trinity" in the Amharic language used in Ethiopia. Soon after taking the throne, Selassie was instrumental in the creation of the first written constitution of Ethiopia, a task he would later mention in his autobiography as having planned since his time as regent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1935, the Italian regime led by Benito Mussolini declared war on Ethiopia, invading in the fall. This conflict came to be known as the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (the first having occurred in the late 1800s). After brief fighting between the Italian and Ethiopian forces, including several battles led by Selassie himself, Italy succeeded in occupying and eventually annexing the African nation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With Italy's successful campaign against Ethiopia, Haile Selassie was forced into exile, but not before pleading the case for Ethiopia's defense at the League of Nations. Despite his galvanizing speech that railed against the Fascist movement of Italy, his plea fell on deaf ears, and Selassie was left to bide his time. He would spend the next five years residing in England, where he continued to speak out against the Italian occupation and attempted to garner support from the international community for a movement to reclaim his country.</Text>

			<Text>With the outbreak of World War II, in 1939, efforts were finally undertaken to liberate Ethiopia from the Italian regime, spearheaded by the British during the East African Campaign. Joined by selected units of the Ethiopian military, this liberation army came to be known as the Gideon Force and was instrumental in the fight to retake the Ethiopian homeland. By 1942, the Italians had surrendered and were forced to acknowledge the renewed sovereignty of Ethiopia, with Haile Selassie returning to the capital city of Addis Ababa. Having found little solidarity in the League of Nations, Selassie became a major proponent of the United Nations, with its increased provisions for international security, and secured Ethiopia's position as a founding member in 1948.</Text>

			<Text>Over the following years, Selassie continued his quest to modernize Ethiopia through reform while also improving his nation's foreign affairs and international recognition. In the 1960s Selassie led the Organization of African Unity, predecessor to the modern African Union. With the goal of creating solidarity between the independent states of the African continent, Selassie believed that a unified voice would strengthen the people of Africa. Although Selassie tried to establish the organization as more than just an ideological entity, the organization was left with little authority or actual power without the backing of a military force.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While working with the international community, Selassie was also focused on improving the welfare of his people at home. Although his efforts to break the nobility's hold on land ownership were met with limited success, the initiative sparked a movement that carried on past his reign. Reforms were also made to provide greater access to educational facilities, while economic programs ensured a just system of taxation. Despite the goodwill generated by these domestic programs, Selassie's efforts to increase his own authority through modifications to the constitution resulted in an increasingly visible dissident movement.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Late in the 1960s, Marxist ideologies took root in Ethiopia, and as the people suffered through a famine and drought in the early 1970s, Selassie's popularity dwindled. An economic crisis that led to soaring inflation would be the final straw, as Selassie tenuously maintained his position until 1974, when he was deposed and arrested by a Marxist military group known as The Derg.</Text>

			<Text>Theodora, wife of Justinian I and Empress of the Byzantine Empire, ruled one of history's preeminent empires during the 1st millennium AD. Known today as the most influential woman of the Byzantine Empire, Emperor Justinian named Theodora co-ruler of the empire, trusting in her wise counsel to guide his reign. Rising from humble beginnings, Theodora would become known throughout the empire - and history - as a tactful, trusted advisor to her emperor. She would be so crucial to the progress of the empire that some think it was Theodora, not Emperor Justinian, who truly guided the people of Byzantium during her lifetime.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_THEODORA_TEXT_2">
			<Text>Most of our knowledge of Theodora comes from the writings of noted Byzantine historian Procopius of Caesarea, who extensively documented the life and times of the Byzantine Empire during Theodora's reign in the 6th century. Theodora's early life as we know it was a colorful one, her father having been a bear-keeper at the Hippodrome, her mother an acrobat. Said to have had exceptional intelligence and wit, Theodora supported herself independently as an actress for some time before catching the eye of Justinian, then heir to the throne of his uncle, Justin I.</Text>

			<Text>As mistress to Justinian, Theodora's beauty and intelligence made such an impression that he elevated her to the rank of patrician, where she joined the aristocratic families of the empire. Although Byzantine law prevented members of the government from marrying entertainers such as Theodora, Justinian's devotion to her was apparently enough that he had the law repealed. In 525, Justinian and Theodora were married, and shortly after his ascension to the throne as Emperor in 527, Theodora became "Augusta," or Empress of the Byzantine Empire. </Text>

			<Text>Theodora was no ordinary consort to the Emperor; Justinian ensured that she was named co-ruler, an important distinction that provided her with a much greater role in political affairs. During her reign, she was influential in the institution of numerous progressive (even by modern standards) policies. Theodora is credited with pressing Justinian to increase the rights of women within the empire, not only expanding their right to property ownership, but also reforming divorce laws that previously favored men.</Text>

			<Text>Theodora was what is known as a "Monophysite Christian," meaning she believed that Jesus Christ was an entirely divine being, unlike the more prevalent Orthodox belief that Jesus had a dual nature (divine yet with an earthly body). This ideology was highly controversial at the time, and considered divisive and heretical by many members of the Orthodox Church. Despite Justinian's Orthodox beliefs, Theodora maintained her own independence as a Monophysite, and even sheltered the Monophysite leaders who were often oppressed by the Orthodox majority. Theodora is also known to have founded a Monophysite monastery in the city of Sycae near Constantinople.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_THEODORA_TEXT_6">
			<Text>The fortitude of Theodora and Justinian would be tested during the Nika Revolt, an uprising led by two opposing political factions (the Greens and the Blues), who attempted to install a rival Emperor to usurp Justinian's power. As the story goes, Justinian's natural instinct was to flee the city, but Theodora encouraged him to stand fast. Imploring Justinian to remain in the city, Theodora argued that it was better to die as an Emperor than as a fugitive. Believing in the wisdom of Theodora's words, Justinian remained in Constantinople and ordered his most loyal general, Flavius Belisarius, to attack the rebels. Herding the dissidents into the Hippodrome, Belisarius and his men annihilated them, brutally killing thousands, and quashing the rebellion.</Text>

			<Text>Widely considered both founder and liberator of the Netherlands, William, Prince of Orange, also known as "William the Silent," led a successful rebellion in the mid-16th century against the Spanish Habsburg Dynasty who held dominion over the Dutch Low Countries. Once the loyal servant of King Philip II of Spain, William eventually became the most prominent leader of the rebellion, as his growing distaste for the continued Spanish persecution of Dutch Protestants came to a head. Rallying his fellow noblemen to the cause, William became an outlaw in the eyes of the Spanish monarch and led the Dutch forces in a number of successful battles against the king before falling to an assassin's bullet in 1584.</Text>

			<Text>Born to Count William of Nassau in 1533, William inherited the title of Prince of Orange at age 11 when his cousin Rene, then prince, died without an heir to his title and land holdings. During this period the Netherlands were controlled by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who ruled as leader of the Habsburg Monarchy, while also serving as king of Spain. While receiving all of the education and training expected of a nobleman, William later became a favored member of the Emperor's court. The emperor's connection to the Spanish crown would play an important role in William's future efforts to wrest control of the Netherlands from Spain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Promoted through the ranks of the military, by his early twenties, William was already a commander in the Imperial army, while also holding various diplomatic posts as an advisor to the Emperor. However, William's favor with the Emperor came at the price of his faith, as his Lutheran upbringing was abandoned in favor of Roman Catholicism to facilitate his rise to power.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_WILLIAM_TEXT_3">
			<Text>In 1555, Charles relinquished the crown of Spain to his son, Philip II. Philip was known for his ruthless disregard for the lives of the Protestants under his rule, showing little empathy for their beliefs and expanding the powers of the Inquisition against the Reformation. In serving his new king, William began to understand the true intentions of Philip, who had no qualms about wiping out the Protestants by whatever means necessary. Although William adopted Catholicism as part of his education, he was raised a Lutheran, and still firmly believed in the right of the people to follow their own beliefs. As the story goes, William overheard a conversation between Philip and King Henry II of France while on a hunting expedition, discussing the future extermination of the Protestants in both of their kingdoms. This event is said to have sparked William's decision to oppose Philip and Spanish control of the Netherlands.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In attempting to subdue the established Protestants in the Netherlands and drive them into exile or worse, Philip devised a system of "placards." These placards served as edicts making the practice of Lutheran and Calvinist beliefs an offense punishable by torture and death. So extreme was the persecution that many Dutch Catholics joined the Protestants in opposing Philip's policies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]William began to openly criticize the king in public, making his opinions on the matter clear, and encouraging others to stand up to repressive policies of Philip. In 1566, the Compromise of Nobles, a collective of noblemen from the Netherlands, petitioned the Spanish regent Margaret of Parma to end the persecution of Protestants within the Netherlands. Despite their efforts for a peaceful resolution, Philip rejected the forwarded petition, and in response, iconoclasm spread throughout the Dutch territory, leading to the destruction of Catholic icons across the country by Protestant rebels.</Text>

			<Text>As iconoclasm spread along with increasingly public displays of forbidden Protestant worship, Philip sent the Duke of Alba, Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, known as the "Iron Duke," to the Netherlands to quash the uprising and deal with the rebels. Upon his arrival, the duke established the Council of Troubles, later known among the Protestants as "The Council of Blood," to oversee the trial and punishment of the rebels and their leadership. Many of those summoned to the council went into hiding, including William himself, but some 1000 or more Protestants are said to have been tried and executed at the hands of the Iron Duke.</Text>

			<Text>While funding the uprising from his home in Nassau, William and the rebels established several armies to attack the Spanish on multiple fronts. The group of Protestant exiles and Dutch noblemen resisting the Spanish came to be known as the "Geuzen," or "Beggars," with the most prominent force being the "Watergeuzen" - the Sea Beggars. William used his wealth to fund the Sea Beggars and equip their vessels, which they used to raid coastal cities throughout the Netherlands, acting as privateers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]William's brother, Louis of Nassau, led an army of mercenaries and French Huguenots (French Protestants) against a Spanish force under the command of Jean de Ligne, himself a Dutch nobleman still loyal to Philip. Meeting at the Battle of Heiligerlee in the northern Dutch province of Groningen in 1568, Louis routed the Spanish army and Jean de Ligne was killed. Unfortunately, William and Louis' second brother, Adolph, was also killed while leading the Dutch cavalry. This historic battle is considered by historians to mark the onset of the Eighty Years' War, as the great conflict for Dutch independence came to be known.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the Battle of Jemmingen shortly thereafter, Louis's army was crushed by the Spanish forces while attempting to seize the city of Groningen itself, forcing his retreat. William himself took up the charge and led an army of Dutch forces to several victories, inspiring the Dutch people as more and more cities throughout the Netherlands were wrested from Spanish control. Despite the Dutch gains, capturing and controlling much of the northern territory over the next decade, the Spanish continued to maintain a firm grasp on the southern Netherlands.</Text>

Although not yet fully independent, the union clearly marked a turning point in rejecting Spanish governance of the region. While Spain still controlled the southern territories, in 1581, the Act of Abjuration finally served as a formal declaration of the Low Countries' independence from Philip's rule.

Less than two years later, William was again attacked by an assassin, this time by a French Roman Catholic named Balthasar Gerard. Attacking William at his home, Balthasar fired three shots, the fatal blow striking William in the chest.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the coming days, Balthasar was tried and sentenced to death.

			<Text>Found in southern Spain, the Alhambra is a large palace complex of the Nasrid Dynasty, who controlled the region in the mid 14th century. Construction first began sometime around 1238 AD under the rule of Ibn al-Ahmar, and continued under his successors. Taking its name from the red hue of its walls, the name Alhambra is translated as the "Red Fortress." Noted for its Moorish Islamic architectural style, the Alhambra features elaborate engravings and numerous examples of the interlacing patterns known as "Arabesques" found predominately in Islamic art. Although many examples of the original Islamic style remain today, much of the palace and its interior was reconstructed and modified after the rise of Catholicism in Spain.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_GATLINGGUN_TEXT">
			<Text>The Gatling gun, forerunner to the machine gun, was invented in 1861 AD by the American Dr. Richard Gatling in the hope of reducing the size of armies and displaying how futile war is. Operation of a Gatling gun involved a revolving multi-barrel design, in which a hand crank turned the mechanism. As each barrel cycled, the spent cartridge was ejected, a new one loaded, and the muzzle barrel cooled. In this manner, a high rate of fire could be maintained without overheating. What the Gatling gun lacked in accuracy was made up for by its lethality.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although not officially adopted by the United States Army until 1866, it was used for the first time in combat during the American Civil War by Union forces. It next saw use during the Peru-Chile War of the Pacific (1879-1883), which convinced European armies of its utility against massed enemies. Within a decade, the Gatling gun was adopted by most of the major powers; it was used most effectively to expand their colonial empires against the likes of the Ndebele, Zulu, Bedouins, Turkmen, Boxers, and other native peoples. In the first decade of the 1900s, designs for gas-operated "machine" guns made the weapon obsolete; the U.S. Army withdrew all models of the Gatling gun from service in 1911, followed soon after by the European armies.</Text>

Inspired by their victory, they began a more offensive campaign, capturing other cities along the coast.

			<Text>Nas cidades pré-industriais, os artesãos tendiam a formar associações - ou guildas comerciais - baseadas em sua profissão; essas guildas tinham a intenção de proteger os segredos da arte, bem como promover a influência e a renda dos artesãos. Predecessores das guildas comerciais foram encontrados no século III a.C. em Roma e na China Han. Por volta de 300 d.C., a prática de artesãos se unindo se espalhou para Índia Gupta e Egito Ptolemaico. Na Idade Média, as organizações de guildas se espalharam rapidamente da Itália por toda a Europa; Registros do século XII em Paris e Londres listam mais de 100 guildas constituídas pelas cidades. Em alguns casos, eram tão poderosas algumas guildas que se tornaram o corpo governante das cidades, indicadas pelos guildhalls encontrados na Alemanha, Suíça e Holanda.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Com o tempo, as guildas assumiram a tarefa de salvaguardar a qualidade e instrução no ofício, com uma progressão ao longo da vida do aprendiz ao grande mestre. Para garantir a qualidade do produto, o sistema de marcas registradas que indicava que o item havia passado pelos padrões da guilda e do governo evoluiu. No entanto, com o passar do tempo, a influência e o poder das guildas diminuíram à medida que se fragmentavam com a chegada de novos negócios, preocupações do governo e métodos de produção em massa. Na França, por exemplo, as guildas foram abolidas em 1791 d.C. pela Lei Le Chapelier; outros países logo fizeram o mesmo. Embora largamente suplantado por sindicatos na Era Industrial, ainda existem exemplos de guildas existentes, notavelmente nos ramos do cinema, literatura e outras profissões artísticas.</Text>

Modern historians estimate that up to 100,000 people may have been killed as a result of the quake, and extensive reconstruction efforts were required to rebuild the crumbling city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the present day, Lisbon is home to more than 500,000 residents and serves as one of Portugal's leading centers of commerce and trade. Lisbon is also a popular tourist destination, as the city features numerous examples of historic architecture, along with several famous museums and cultural festivals.</Text>

It wasn't until 1571 however, with the arrival of Spanish Conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, that the existing settlements were destroyed, and the reconstructed city first came to be known as Manila. For the next 300 years, Manila and the Philippine islands remained under Spanish control. In 1898, Spain relinquished the Philippine territories to the United States after the Spanish-American War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Manila's port, simply known as the Port of Manila, is one of the busiest seaports in the world, and the primary means of import and export within the Philippines. With a diverse variety of exported products, ranging from food and local commodities, to chemicals and industrial products, the Philippines rely heavily on Manila's port to maintain their flourishing economy. Tourism is also a major component of the local economy in Manila, as visitors come from around the world to see the historic walled district within Manila known as the Intramuros.</Text>

The city's reputation as a commercial center and trade hub can be attributed to its earliest roots, when caravans stopped in Marrakech to rest and regroup before continuing along the surrounding trade routes. Marrakech's famous market, found in the Jemaa el-Fnaa square in the old city, features elaborate stalls with vendors selling everything from local cuisine to crafts and other items directed at tourists. Performances of varying types are also common in the square, with snake charmers, dancers, and other forms of entertainment continuing into the night.

Mombasa was also known for its vast network of plantations producing coconuts, cashews, and millet, which were then shipped out along the trade routes crossing the Indian Ocean. Mombasa's port, known as the Kilindini Harbor, is the only international seaport in Kenya, which has allowed the city to become a major center of commerce and trade for the entire nation.

			<Text>The capital city of the Republic of Malta, located south of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea, Valletta was founded by Jean Parisot de la Valette, Grandmaster of the Order of Malta. The island of Malta was given to the Knights Hospitaller, a Christian military order, by Spanish King Charles V in 1530 during the height of the Islamic Ottoman Empire's power. This eventually led to the famous Siege of Malta in 1565, when the Ottomans moved to invade the island and conquer the Knights. In successfully repelling the invasion, the Order of Malta decided to construct a new, fortified city to ensure their position would be secure from future attacks. Valetta was founded along the Maltese coastline, an ideal location that provided easy access to two major harbors. The Grand Harbor, as it's known today, is the most crucial port on Malta, handling much of the republic's import and export duties.</Text>

Although the city was well-established within the Holy Roman Empire as the seat of power for the Elector of Saxony, it was Martin Luther's revolt that put Wittenberg on the map.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While teaching theology at the University of Wittenberg, Martin Luther first expressed his distaste for the selling of indulgences - the process of paying the Catholic Church for the forgiveness of sin. In 1517, Martin Luther famously nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, sparking the Protestant Reformation across Europe. Although it would take more than a century before the religious wars spurred by the Reformation were resolved, Wittenberg was always remembered as the wellspring for Martin Luther's dissidence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]More recently, Wittenberg was consumed by the conflicts of World War II, although much of the city's historic center was spared from the devastation of the allied bombing campaign.

As one of the oldest religions still in practice today, it is believed that Judaism first appeared some 3500 years ago, as one of the earliest Monotheistic religions. Despite their inherent differences, many aspects of Judaism are closely tied with both Christianity and Islam, as they are all considered "Abrahamic" religions, meaning they are descended from Abraham.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Central to Judaism is the Torah, the name given by the Jews to the first five books of the Bible. Said to have been given to Moses at Mt. Sinai, the Torah outlines the means by which the Jews can live according to God's will. Although Judaism's core doctrines have been debated by scholars for centuries, the Jews believe they are the Chosen People, selected by God to be in covenant with him, and that God will send a messiah to bring all of the chosen back to Israel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although the Jews have been persecuted throughout history and scattered across the world, Judaism as a religion has prevailed, and the Jews' continued faith in God has not been broken despite the atrocities committed against them.</Text>

Sikhism has over 20 million followers in the present-day, based primarily in the Punjab region of India. The Sikhs believe in only one god, who has no physical form, but every Sikh has the ability to speak to God, and all are equal in God's eyes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sikhs are known for their generosity towards others, as one of the primary tenets of their religion is the idea that all people are created equal, regardless of religion, race, or sex. In differing from other major religions, Sikhism supports that belief that acts of good in service to others are more important than any form of ritual. Sikhs are also bound to defend against injustices, supporting all who are oppressed, as truth and peace should prevail above all else. The Sikhs believe that to attain salvation, every Sikh must practice disciplined meditation, as only through personal observance and focus on God can salvation be reached.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are a number of restrictions placed on the followers of the Sikh faith, including the requirement that they not cut their hair, not consume any intoxicating substances, and notably, not perform any ritual, superstition, or pilgrimage.</Text>

			<Text>Followed by more than 350 million people throughout the world today, Buddhism is based on the teachings of revered spiritual leader Siddhattha Gotama, known as the "Supreme Buddha," meaning "the enlightened one." As the central figure of Buddhism, Buddha was not recognized as a god, nor did he presume to claim a connection to God. Rather, Buddha taught his followers a path to enlightenment based on his own life experience, a distinction that differentiates Buddhism from many of the world's major religions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Buddhism's primary tenets, the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, lay out the means by which one can achieve Nirvana, or peace from unending suffering. In their simplest form, the Four Noble Truths tell us that life is suffering, that suffering arises from our attachment to desires, that suffering ceases when attachment to desire ceases, and that freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the eightfold path. As the name implies, there are eight aspects to the Eightfold Path, each describing the practice required to fully understand the Four Noble Truths.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the present-day, there are three major schools of Buddhism. The largest, Theravada and Mahayana, are known as sutric schools, and they believe that the primary means of attaining enlightenment is through the careful study of Buddha's teachings. The third, Vajrayana, is a tantric school, meaning they believe they can accelerate the process of enlightenment through the use of yoga, mantras, and other rituals.</Text>

With over one billion followers throughout the world today (most being concentrated in India), Hinduism also has one of the largest followings of any major religion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although Hinduism cannot be attributed to a single founder, the religion has grown on the basis of the writings found in the Vedas, which focus on a single, unifying force that governs all aspects of our existence. Although there are a number of widely recognizable gods within Hinduism, notably Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma, these deities are all but a small part of the greater God. Dharma, or the "Ultimate Reality," is the universal power or law by which all things that exist are bound. Through endless cycles of death and rebirth, Hindus believe that the only means of breaking free from unending reincarnation is through meditation and the realization that God is in all things. Hindus also believe in Karma, by which our deeds, both good and bad, have a cause and effect relationship on how our lives progress.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although there are a number of competing sects within Hinduism and the schools may differ in their interpretation of the ancient manuscripts, they do not view each other as rivals, and in fact share ideas and opinions openly amongst one another.</Text>

Originally introduced as an ethical and social philosophy, Confucianism has grown to a following of several million in the present-day, mainly concentrated in the regions of East Asia. During his life, Confucius hoped to instill a strong belief in personal morality, social responsibility, and family loyalty, as each person served their role in society. As a humanist philosophy, Confucianism focuses on the ability of every human being to learn, grow, and improve through ethical behavior and consideration for others.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following Confucius' death in approximately 479 BC, his teachings saw widespread growth for nearly 200 years until attempts at suppressing the philosophy were undertaken in earnest by the Qin Dynasty. The Qin rulers believed that Confucianism was a direct threat to their authority, and, as a result, they had most Confucian books burned, including many of Confucius' original writings. Temples were also destroyed across the country, leaving little sanctuary for the followers of Confucianism. Despite these attempts to wipe out the Confucian belief system, a hidden store of Confucian manuscripts was discovered in the walls of a scholar's home, and the religion found new life after the fall of the Qin in 206 BC.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the present-day, the works of Confucianism are studied by scholars throughout the world.

			<Text>With no founding figure, and no central doctrine, Shinto is a spiritual belief of the Japanese people based on an individual's connection to the world, and to Japan itself. One of the central aspects of Shintoism is the worship of spirits, known as Kami, who are acknowledged through the visiting of shrines. Although the Kami are not considered gods, they are spirits or entities with close ties to humans, and they can have a beneficial effect on the course of one's existence. However, Shinto is not focused on the belief in Kami, but on the ritual of devotion itself. By paying your respects to the Kami at shrines, you are showing your interest and as such the Kami may bring positive benefits to your life.

At one time one of the largest religions in the world, Zoroastrian is only followed today by an estimated 200,000 adherents, living primarily in India, Pakistan, and Iran. Zoroastrianism is considered by some to be the oldest monotheistic religion in the world, although this is a point of contention among scholars. Zoroastrian beliefs are centered on the creator god Ahura Mazda, who is the focal point of all Zoroastrian tradition and worship. It is said that Ahura Mazda revealed his wisdom to Zoroaster, who then spread the teachings across the region. The sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, known collectively as the Avesta, contain hymns said to have been written by Zoroaster himself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As with many religions, Zoroastrianism outlines the ways in which we can live in harmony with the surrounding world, in this case through good thoughts and good actions. Zoroastrians are often mischaracterized as fire worshippers, in part because of the prevalence of fire as a symbol in Zoroastrian rituals. In Zoroastrianism, fire represents the light of Ahura Mazda, and believers will always pray in the direction of the light, rather than worshipping the fire itself.</Text>

During his time spreading the word of God, Jesus is said to have performed miracles as he taught his followers how to purify themselves of sin. Giving sight to the blind, curing the sick, and turning water into wine were all miracles said to have been performed by Jesus. His eventual betrayal by Judas and his crucifixion by the Romans served only to spread his renown, as his disciples claimed that he appeared before them three days after his death, rising from the grave and ascending to heaven.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The largest schools of Christianity are Roman Catholicism, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Protestantism.

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_RELIGION_ISLAM_PEDIA">
			<Text>The second largest religion in the world, Islam, is based on the belief that there is only one true God, Allah, and he has made his will known through a number of prophets on Earth. The most important of these prophets, Muhammad, recorded God's words in the Muslim holy book, the Koran.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Born in the city of Mecca (in modern Saudi Arabia) in 570 AD, Muhammad was raised as a merchant and later worked as a shepherd. However, at age 40, he experienced visions from God, and recorded God's word verbatim in the Koran. From this point forward, Muhammad preached the word of God and instructed his followers that the only true path to salvation was to devote themselves entirely to God through daily prayer, and the strict adherence to the laws set forth by God. The Five Pillars of Islam, the framework through which salvation can be attained, state in their most basic form that there is no god but God, and Muhammad is his prophet; one must pray daily to God at the five established times; one must give to the needy to support them; one must fast from dawn until dusk during the month of Ramadan; and one must make a pilgrimage to Mecca, at least once, during the holy month of Dhu al-Hijjah.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As was the case with the founding of many religions, Muhammad and his followers were met by staunch resistance from other faiths. Despite this, Muhammad's message spread across the Middle East following his death in 632 AD. Since that time, Islam has splintered into a number of competing branches, the largest being the Sunni and Shia denominations. Although bound by their overarching beliefs, these sects differed in their interpretation of who should lead Islam's following since the time of Muhammad's death.</Text>

        If you take a City-State that has been captured by another Civilization, you have the choice to annex the City-State, make it a puppet, or liberate it. If you choose to liberate a City-State, then it will always vote for you in UN elections, no matter what its relations are with you at the time of the vote. If the same City-State has been liberated more than once, it will vote for the Civ which liberated it most recently.[NEWLINE]If a Civilization has been removed from the game and you capture one of that Civ's cities, you have the option of annexing it, making it your puppet, or liberating it. If you choose to liberate it, the Civilization returns to play and will hold you in high regard. And while you are not guaranteed their vote in the UN elections, this huge positive modifier should make it easier to convince them to vote for you.
